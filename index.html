<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Two Towers</h2><p>The standard hardcover edition of the second volume of The Lord of the Rings includes a large format fold-out map. Frodo and his Companions of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in a battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked by Orcs. Now they continue the journey alone down the great River Anduin -- alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go.</p><p>THE GREATEST FANTASY EPIC OF OUR TIME <br>The Fellowship was scattered. Some were bracing hopelessly for war against the ancient evil of Sauron. Some were contending with the treachery of the wizard Saruman. Only Frodo and Sam were left to take the accursed Ring of Power to be destroyed in Mordor-the dark Kingdom where Sauron was supreme. Their guide was Gollum, deceitful and lust-filled, slave to the corruption of the Ring. <br>Thus continues the magnificent, bestselling tale of adventure begun in "The Fellowship of the Ring, which reaches its soul-stirring climax in "The Return of the King.<br>In the First Part of The Lord of the Rings, 111-year-old Bilbo Baggins (hero of The Hobbit) passed along his magical ring to his orphaned nephew, Frodo--unwittingly setting its original owner, the horrible Gollum, on his trail. Lest the ring fall into evil hands, Frodo sought to destroy it at the Mountain of Fire in the enemy land of Mordor. He convened the Companions of the Ring to carry out this perilous mission, but his brave band has been scattered, beset by orc-soldiers, and in the Second Part, as &#39;the great Darkness&#39; descends, Frodo himself has mysteriously disappeared.</p><h2>The Little SAS Book: A Primer, Fourth Edition</h2><p>Now in its fourth edition, The Little SAS Book is a classic, helping many people learn SAS programming.

Even in translation, the unique system of logic and involved argumentation often baffle the inexperienced reader.<br><br>The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition makes it possible for everyone to read the Talmud because it is more than just a translation. Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz becomes your personal instructor, guiding you through the intricate paths of Talmudic logic and thought. His extensive introductions and commentaries make the text crystal clear by providing all the background information needed to follow it, while his illustrated marginal notes supply fascinating insights into daily life in Talmudic times.<br><br>This volume, Tractate Bava Metzia, Part One, is one of the first sections traditionally studied by newcomers to the Talmud, since it contains so many or' the basic elements common to all Talmudic logic. It focuses on the resolution of disputes that may arise in daily life and commercial transactions, such as rival claims to the ownership of property.<br><br>Many related issues involving claims inevitably come under examination, such as contracts (including marriage contracts and bills of divorce), loans, promissory notes, and other such documents. There is much discussion of how the courts should proceed, including whether or not an oath, which is considered by the Talmud to be a matter of gave consequence, was to be administered to the various claimants.<br><br>The extraordinary sensitivity of the courts to ensuring absolute justice for all parties is reflected on every page. And as with all Talmudic discussions, the interplay of personalities and the subtleties of human relationships give rise to a host of possibilities that reflect human life as a whole.</p><p>Scholar, teacher, mystic, scientist and social critic, Adin Steinsaltz is internationally regarded as one of the leading rabbis of this century.<br><br>Hailed by Time magazine as "a once-in-a-millennium scholar," Rabbi Steinsaltz has set as his life's goal the popularization of the Talmud. Over twenty volumes of his monumental translation into modern Hebrew have now been published by the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications, which he heads, and they have sold more than a million copies worldwide. With its full punctuation, vocalization and crystal-clear commentaries, The Steinsaltz Edition has enabled far greater numbers of people to become familiar with the Talmud than ever before.<br><br>However, as Rabbi Steinsaltz says, "We now have a major part of the Jewish people whose native tongue is English and who are really not comfortable with any other language." This English edition, therefore, is designed to further his aim of bringing the Talmud to as broad an audience as possible.<br><br>Rabbi Steinsaltz has been a resident scholar at both Yale University and the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton. In 1988 he was invited to open a Judaic Studies Center in Moscow, the first such institution in sixty years, and to supervise the inventory and replication of the Soviet Union's vast libraries and archives of Judaica.<br><br>The same year, Rabbi Steinsaltz was awarded the Israel Prize, his country's highest honor. He is the author of several popular books on Jewish practice and thought, and lives with his family in Jerusalem.</p><h2>�Anda!

A top mob boss, a reputed consigliere, and other high-profile members of the Chicago Outfit were accused in a total of eighteen gangland killings, revealing organized crime&#x2019;s ruthless grip on the city throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Painting a vivid picture of murder, courtroom drama, family loyalties and disloyalties, journalist Jeff Coen accurately portrays the Chicago Outfit&#x2019;s cold-blooded--and sometimes incompetent--killers and their crimes in the case that brought them down. In 1998 Frank Calabrese Jr. volunteered to wear a wire to gather evidence against his father, a vicious loan shark who strangled most of his victims with a rope before slitting their throats to ensure they were dead. Frank Jr. went after his uncle Nick as well, a calculating but sometimes bumbling hit man who would become one of the highest-ranking turncoats in mob history, admitting he helped strangle, stab, shoot, and bomb victims who got in the mob&#x2019;s way, and turning evidence against his brother Frank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chicago courtroom took on the look and feel of a movie set as Chicago&#x2019;s most colorful mobsters and their equally flamboyant attorneys paraded through and performed: James &#x201c;Jimmy Light&#x201d; Marcello, the acting head of the Chicago mob; Joey &#x201c;the Clown&#x201d; Lombardo, one of Chicago&#x2019;s most eccentric mobsters; Paul &#x201c;the Indian&#x201d; Schiro; and a former Chicago police officer, Anthony &#x201c;Twan&#x201d; Doyle, among others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Re-creating events from court transcripts, police records, interviews, and notes taken day after day as the story unfolded in court, Coen provides a riveting wide-angle view and one of the best accounts on record of the inner workings of the Chicago syndicate and its control over the city&#x2019;s streets.</p><p><strong>Jeff Coen is a reporter for the <i>Chicago Tribune,</i> covering federal trials and investigations from the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in downtown Chicago. He was present in the courtroom throughout the Family Secrets trial, and his pieces on the case were featured in a popular series in the <i>Chicago</i><i> Tribune.</i> </strong>Coen, a <i>Chicago Tribune</i> reporter, dissects one of the most pivotal mob criminal prosecutions, the Family Secrets case, in his revealing, shocking book on self-destructive Cosa Nostra members engaged in a death dance of suspicion and betrayal. Members of the Chicago Syndicate, also known as the Outfit, under the taut leadership of Frank Calabrese Sr., did their share of graft, bribery, extortion, bookmaking and murder, much like in the glory Capone days, but in 1998, Calabresi's son Frank Jr.&#x2014;who had had it with his father's abusive ways and broken promises&#x2014;decided to become an FBI turncoat and get the goods on his father and the powerful men around him. Giving an unfettered glimpse into the strata of the Chicago criminal organization, Coen tallies the strategies of the clever mob mouthpieces, the extensive wise guy body count, and the Feds' relentless pursuit through the indictment and sentencing. Superbly crafted, this is a tragic, clear-sighted account of how Chicago's mighty mob was brought to heel.

The two-part structure of this rhetoric/reader includes a complete pedagogical apparatus--with coverage of critical reading strategies, as well as writing, researching, and documenting a topic--and an anthology of readings grouped into nine thematic clusters. In-depth instruction, combined with real student writings, engages students and helps them discover their own voices. The text&#39;s visual emphasis and the authors&#39; practical skill-building approach are enhanced with a new full-color format. Each chapter in Part I ends with a &#34;Summary,&#34; &#34;Checklist,&#34; and &#34;Writing Projects,&#34; while each cluster in Part II ends with &#34;Connections Among the Clusters,&#34; &#34;Writing Projects,&#34; and &#34;Suggestions for Further Reading.&#34; These sections encourage students to apply what they&#39;ve learned and go beyond the classroom if a topic is of particular interest to them. In addition to guidance on drafting and revising arguments, the authors provide a variety of composition strategies, including freewriting, outlining, and shared reading. A new chaper on &#34;Arguing Across the Disciplines&#34; provides strategies for arguing effectively when writing in a variety of majors.</p><p>Fred D.

E. Sue Blume shows how incest is often at the root of such problems as depression, sexual and eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, and phobias and panic disorders. Using this information and the author's guidance, survivors can identify themselves, develop alternative, nondestructive survival techniques and begin again on a new path toward a rich and empowered life. <p>"From the Paperback edition.</p>A therapist who works with incest victims, Blume offers help, advice, and support while exploring in depth the devastation wrought by this crime. She expands the definition of incest to include sexual abuse perpetrated by any caregiver (including teachers, relatives, or neighbors). Her book is written for those who know that they have been abused as well as those who have blocked such abuse from their memories. The "Incest Survivor Aftereffects Checklist" describes the many ways incest affects its victims. Using the concepts delineated in the checklist Blume explores how victims protect themselves against awareness that cannot be faced through aftereffects such as dreams, addictions, and interpersonal issues. She then offers numerous specific suggestions for recovery, including descriptions and evaluations of therapeutic interventions in the final chapter.<br><i>- Jodith Janes, Cleveland Clinic Foundation</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics.

Inspired by a brief passage in <em>Moby-Dick</em>, Sena Jeter Naslund has created an enthralling and compellingly readable saga, spanning a rich, eventful, and dramatic life. At once a family drama, a romantic adventure, and a portrait of a real and loving marriage, <em>Ahab's Wife</em> gives new perspective on the American experience.</p><p>This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.</p></p><p>It has been said that one can see farther only by standing on the shoulders of giants. <i>Ahab's Wife</i>, Sena Naslund's epic work of historical fiction, honors that aphorism, using Herman Melville's <i> Moby-Dick</i> as looking glass into early-19th-century America. Through the eye of an outsider, a woman, she suggests that New England life was broader and richer than Melville's manly world of men, ships, and whales. This ambitious novel pays tribute to Melville, creating heroines from his lesser characters, and to America's literary heritage in general. <p> Una, named for the heroine of Edmund Spenser's <i>Faerie Queene</i>, flees to the New England coast from Kentucky to escape her father's puritanism and to pursue a more exalted life. She gets whaling out of her system early: going to sea at 16 disguised as a boy, Una has her ship sunk by her own monstrous whale, and survives a harrowing shipwreck: </p><blockquote> I was so horrified by the whale's deliberate charge that I could not move. Then my own name flew up from below like a spear: "Una!" Giles' voice broke my trance, and I scrambled down the rigging. No sooner did my foot touch the deck than there was such a lurch that I fell to my face. I heard and felt the boards break below the waterline, the copper sheathing nothing but decorative foil. The whole ship shuddered. A death throe. </blockquote> The ship dies, but Una returns to land to pursue the life of the mind. The novel's opening line--"Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last"--also diminishes Melville's hero in the broader scheme of things. Naslund exposes the reader to the unsung, real-life heroes of Melville's world, including Margaret Fuller and her Boston salon, and Nantucket astronomer Maria Mitchell. There is a chance meeting with a veiled Nathaniel Hawthorne in the woods, and throughout the novel the story brims with references to the giants of literature: Shakespeare, Goethe, Coleridge, Keats, and Wordsworth. Although her novel runs long at nearly 700 pages, Naslund has created an imaginative, entertaining, and very impressive work. <i>--Ted Leventhal</i><p>Sena Jeter Naslund is a cofounder and program director of the Spalding University (Louisville) brief-residency MFA in Writing, where she edits <em>The Louisville Review</em> and Fleur-de-Lis Press.

As a weapon-based system, all techniques are integrated with equipment, physical challenges, and tactics found on the modern battlefield. The MCMAP is designed to increase the warfighting capabilities of individual Marines and units, enhance Marines&#x2019; self-confidence and esprit de corps, and foster the warrior ethos in all Marines. The MCMAP is a weapon-based system rooted in the credo that every Marine is a rifleman and will engage the aggressor from 500 meters to close quarter combat. The MCMAP:</p><ul><li>Enhances the Marine Corps&#x2019; capabilities as an elite fighting force.</li><li>Provides basic combative skills for all Marines.</li><li>Applies across the spectrum of violence.</li> <li>Strengthens the Marine Corps warrior ethos.</li></ul><p>The motto of MCMAP best states the essence of the program: &#x201c;One mind, any weapon.&#x201d; This means that every Marine is always armed even without a weapon. He is armed with a combat mindset, the ability to assess and to act, and the knowledge that all Marines can rely on one another.</p><p>The Marine Corps was born during the battles that created this country. Drawing upon the experiences of the first Marines, we have developed a martial culture unrivaled in the world today. This legacy includes not only our fighting prowess but also the character and soul of what makes us unique as Marines.</p><p><b>Search for 'CARLILE MILITARY LIBRARY' to find more TOP-FLIGHT, SQUARED-AWAY publications for your professional bookshelf!</b></p><p><b>Published in the U.S.A. by CARLILE MEDIA.</b></p><p><i>Information purposes only.</i></p></p><p></p><h2>Breaking Negative Thinking Patterns: A Schema Therapy Self-Help and Support Book</h2><p><p><i>Breaking Negative Thinking Patterns </i>is the first schema-mode focused resource guide aimed at schema therapy patients and self-help readers seeking to understand and overcome negative patterns of thinking and behaviour.<br><br></p> <ul> <li>Represents the first resource for general readers on the mode approach to schema therapy</li> <li>Features a wealth of case studies that serve to clarify schemas and modes and illustrate techniques for overcoming dysfunctional modes and behavior patterns</li> <li>Offers a series of exercises that readers can immediately apply to real-world challenges and emotional problems as well as the complex difficulties typically tackled with schema therapy</li> <li>Includes original illustrations that demonstrate the modes and approaches in action, along with 20 self-help mode materials which are also available online</li> <li>Written by authors closely associated with the development of schema therapy and the schema mode approach</li> </ul></p><p><i>Breaking Negative Thinking Patterns</i> presents the first schema-mode focused resource guide aimed both at current schema therapy patients and anyone interested in changing thinking and behavior patterns that are standing in the way of happiness, fulfillment, or success.

Though the game is never actually played in Kate Atkinson's remarkable novel, <i>Human Croquet</i>, the parallels between plot and pastime are undeniable. Atkinson, winner of the 1995 Whitbread Award in Britain, tells the story of Isobel Fairfax and her older brother, Charles. The children's parents vanished when they were young, leaving them to the care of their grandmother, now dead, and their Aunt Vinny. Recently their father has returned with "the Debbie-wife" in tow, and they all live in Arden, the family's ancestral home built on the foundations of the original manor house that burned to the ground in 1605. According to family legend, the first Fairfax took a wife who mysteriously disappeared one day, leaving in her wake a curse on the Fairfax name. More than 300 years later, Fairfax descendants are still struggling with this painful legacy. <p>Atkinson's novel is obviously not rooted in dull reality. Narrator Isobel has an uncanny knowledge of past and future events; Charles is obsessed with the concept of parallel universes and time travel; and a faery curse hangs over everybody. Fortunately, Kate Atkinson is a masterful writer who manages to keep her world of wonders in check. <i>Human Croquet</i> is no ordinary novel, and readers who venture into the Fairfax universe are in for a magical ride.</p>"Wonderfully eloquent and forceful Kate Atkinson goes at the same pace in her second novel as she did in her first...welcome back, wild north-easter...brilliant and engrossing"<br>-Penelope Fitzgerald, <i>Evening Standart</i><p>"Huge, exhilarating, loving and detailed eruption of a novel...an utterly intoxicating display of novelistic elan...big and joyous, literary and accessible...storytelling at it buoyant best"<br>-<i>The Scotsman</i></p><p>"Vivid, richly imaginative, hilarious and frightening by turns"<br>-Cressida Connolly, <i>Observer</i></p></p><h2>Electric Discharge Lamps (Monographs in Modern Electrical Technology)</h2><p>In his introduction Dr. Waymouth remarks that "well over half the total amount of light produced in this country, and perhaps the world, is produced by electric discharge lamps." This book brings together an extraordinary amount of data on all the major types of electric discharge lamps which are now in commercial use. Its scope has been limited, however, to a few sources which together account for 99% of the light produced by these lamps: fluorescent lamps, high-pressure mercury lamps, low- and high-pressure sodium lamps, and metal-halide arc lamps. There is also a chapter on discharge lamp operating circuitry.<br> <br> Electric discharge lamps share a number of common features, such as those associated with a radiating body of gas and certain properties of plasmas. Discussion of phenomena in connection with one of them can also apply to others, which enables the author to emphasize unique aspects of behavior in each type of lamp. Much of the material about each lamp type describes the interaction of the various processes that occur and may be understood by readers with little or no mathematical or scientific background. Some chapters on mathematical analyses of specific discharge models may be omitted without missing the physics involved. In most cases technological development of electric discharge lamps has preceded scientific understanding&#x2014;for instance, fluorescent lamps had been marketed for more than a decade with only a qualitative understanding of how they worked before the first quantitative analysis of the important physical processes was published.<br> <br> This is the second volume in the series <i>Research Monographs in Modern Electrical Technology,</i> edited by Alexander Kusko, and it includes extensive references to published work in this area, as well as previously unpublished work from the author's own laboratories.</p><p></p><h2>Understanding Movies [RENTAL EDITION]</h2><p><i>For courses in Introduction to Film</i> <br>&nbsp;<br> <b>An engaging, accessible introduction to film</b> <br> <i> <b>Understanding Movies</b> </i> provides valuable insight into the language of film and how meaning is conveyed to audiences.

Stephens and Frederick Catherwood, who brought the ancient Maya cities to the world's attention. Dr. Clarke set out on a seven-year adventure (from 2003 through 2010) through Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico, collecting stories of encounters, sky gods, giants, little people, and aliens among the indigenous people. She drove more than 12,000 miles, visiting 89 archaeological sites (Stephens and Catherwood visited only 44) and conducting nearly 100 individual interviews.<br><br>The result is an enthralling series of unique, original, true stories of encounters with space travelers, giants, little people, and UFOs. <i>Sky People</i> may very well change the way you perceive and experience the world.</p><p>Dr. Ardy Sixkiller Clarke brings to the field of ufology degrees in history, English, psychology, and educational leadership and a background as a teacher, university professor, administrator, licensed therapist and psychologist, and social science researcher.

It investigates how the court has defined and interpreted the notion of the rule of law in its jurisprudence. It places this analysis against a background of more theoretical accounts of the idea of the rule of law, drawing in ideas of political philosophy. It also provides a comparative assessment, demonstrating how the idea of the rule of law has evolved in the UK, France, and Germany. <br><br>The book argues that at the core of the concept of the rule of law are the notions of legality and judicial safeguards. It states that the Court has developed the requirements of legality, which the work analyses in detail, based on that concept. It assesses the independence of the judiciary as an aspect of the rule of law in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the relationship between the rule of law and the substantive contents of law. The book posits that the rule of law as seen at the Court is not mainly utilised with regard to 'freedom' rights, but is more concerned with procedural rights. It discusses the relationship between the rule of law and the view of the Convention as a constitutional instrument of the European public order, and shows that the rule of law and democracy are inextricably linked in the case law of the Court. Ultimately, the book demonstrates in its analysis of the Court's jurisprudence that the notion of the rule of law is a crucial part of the international legal order.<br></p><p><br>Dr Geranne Lautenbach is a Lecturer in Law at the University of Amsterdam, where she teaches Fundamental Rights, and International Law and European Law in the National Legal Order.<br></p><h2>Swim Smooth: The Complete Coaching System for Swimmers and Triathletes</h2><p>Transform your technique in the water and become a better swimmer with this remarkable new approach to freestyle swimming, suitable for all levels - beginner, intermediate and advanced, as well as swimming coaches.

Kindleberger&#39;s Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises (The Macat Library)</h2><p><p>Perhaps the most peculiar feature of a financial bubble &#x2013; one that Charles Kindleberger's classic work Manias, Panics and Crashes draws particular attention to &#x2013; is the inability of those trapped inside it to grasp the seriousness of their predicament. They know in principle that bubbles exist, and they know that the financial crashes that result from them are capable of destroying individuals' wealth and entire economies. Yet whenever and wherever a bubble begins to form, we're told that this time things are different, that there are sound reasons to continue to invest and to presume that prices will continue to rise steadily forever.</p> <p>Kindleberger's achievement is to use the critical thinking skill of evaluation to examine this strange mindset and the arguments advanced in support of it. He harshly judges the acceptability of the reasons used to create such arguments, and highlights the issues of relevance and adequacy that give us every reason to doubt them. Kindleberger also uses his powers of reasoning to effect an unusual achievement &#x2013; writing a work soundly rooted in economics that nonetheless engages and convinces a non-specialist audience of the correctness of his arguments.</p></p><p><strong>Dr Nicholas Burton </strong>holds a degree in economics from Bowdoin College, Maine, and a DPhil in English literature from Oxford.

Today, it is equated with denouncing him or her as a Nazi. But as intellectual historian Paul E. Gottfried writes in this provocative yet even-handed study, the term's meaning has evolved over the years. Gottfried examines the semantic twists and turns the term has endured since the 1930s and traces the word's polemical function within the context of present ideological struggles. Like "conservatism," "liberalism," and other words whose meanings have changed with time, "fascism" has been used arbitrarily over the years and now stands for a host of iniquities that progressives, multiculturalists, and libertarians oppose, even if they offer no single, coherent account of the historic evil they condemn. Certain factors have contributed to the term's imprecise usage, Gottfried writes, including the equation of all fascisms with Nazism and Hitler, as well as the rise of a post-Marxist left that expresses predominantly cultural opposition to bourgeois society and its Christian and/or national components. Those who stand in the way of social change are dismissed as "fascist," he contends, an epithet that is no longer associated with state corporatism and other features of fascism that were once essential but are now widely ignored. Gottfried outlines the specific historical meaning of the term and argues that it should not be used indiscriminately to describe those who hold unpopular opinions. His important study will appeal to political scientists, intellectual historians, and general readers interested in politics and history.</p></p><p><p>Paul E. Gottfried is the retired Horace Raffensperger Professor of Humanities at Elizabethtown College and a Guggenheim recipient.

Gottfried's navigation of the ins and outs of the interwar ideological quarrels in Italy and France is especially masterful."</p> (Robert Weissberg, emeritus, University of Illinois at Urbana&#x2013;Champaign)<br><br><p>"<i>Fascism</i> is a meticulously researched primer on the true history of one of the world's worst ideologies. Upon finishing the book, readers will emerge with a firmer understanding of history, philosophy, and the ways in which words shape culture and reality."</p> (Jay Lehr, The Heartland Institute)<br><br><p>"Gottfried brings vast erudition and interpretive nuance to the subject of fascism. This book is a significant contribution to the fields of political thought and European history."</p> (Jeff Taylor, Dordt College)</p><h2>A Primer of Ecology</h2><p>A Primer of Ecology, Third Edition, presents a concise but detailed exposition of the most common mathematical models in population and community ecology. It is intended to demystify ecological models and the mathematics behind them by deriving the models from first principles. The book may be used as a self-teaching tutorial by students, as a primary textbook, or as a supplemental text to a general ecology textbook. <p>The Primer explains in detail basic concepts of exponential and logistic population growth, age-structured demography, metapopulation dynamics, competition, predation, island biogeography, and, in a chapter new to this edition, succession. Each chapter is carefully graded from simple material that is appropriate for beginning undergraduates to advanced material, which is suited for upper-division undergraduates and beginning graduate students. Advanced topics include environmental and demographic stochasticity, discrete population growth and chaos, stage-structured demography, intraguild predation, nonlinear predator-prey isoclines, and passive sampling. Each chapter follows the same structure: model presentation and predictions, model assumptions, model variations, empirical examples, and problems. </p><p>Essential equations are highlighted for students' use. Intermediate algebraic "expressions" are also illustrated so that students see where the equations came from. New terms are introduced in the text in boldface type to alert students to novel concepts. The Primer contains more mathematical detail than many ecology textbooks, but avoids jargon and mathematical terminology that can intimidate students. Both simple and advanced problems are included, followed by fully worked solutions so that students can gain confidence and a better understanding of the models.

Eugene Savage (1883-1978) first visited the Florida Everglades in the 1930&#x2019;s, became enchanted with the local Seminole Indian tribe and spent the next 20 years depicting them.<br><br>Savages&#x2019;s paintings, drawings, and watercolours not only document the Seminoles, they are also important works of art in their own right. Each presents Seminole traditions, threatened by encroachment on the Everglades, in an artistic manner reminiscent of Surrealist dreamscapes and Art Deco sensibilities.<br><br>Although Savage&#x2019;s series is perhaps the most extensive painted record of the Florida Seminoles, art historians have largely overlooked these works in favour of studies of the natives of the American Plains or Southwest. This new volume provides an opportunity to re-assess the artist&#x2019;s career, and offers new insights into the representation of the Seminoles in American art.</p><p>Dr. Elizabeth Heuer is an Assistant Professor of Art History at the University of North Florida.

Scott Fitzgerald wrote in a friend's copy of <i>Tender Is the Night,</i> "If you liked <i>The Great Gatsby,</i> for God's sake read this. <i>Gatsby</i> was a tour de force but this is a confession of faith." Set in the South of France in the decade after World War I, <i>Tender Is the Night</i> is the story of a brilliant and magnetic psychiatrist named Dick Diver; the bewitching, wealthy, and dangerously unstable mental patient, Nicole, who becomes his wife; and the beautiful, harrowing ten-year pas de deux they act out along the border between sanity and madness. <br> In <i>Tender Is the Night,</i> Fitzgerald deliberately set out to write the most ambitious and far-reaching novel of his career, experimenting radically with narrative conventions of chronology and point of view and drawing on early breakthroughs in psychiatry to enrich his account of the makeup and breakdown of character and culture. <br> <i>Tender Is the Night</i> is also the most intensely, even painfully, autobiographical of Fitzgerald's novels; it smolders with a dark, bitter vitality because it is so utterly true. This account of a caring man who disintegrates under the twin strains of his wife's derangement and a lifestyle that gnaws away at his sense of moral values offers an authorial cri de coeur, while Dick Diver's downward spiral into alcoholic dissolution is an eerie portent of Fitzgerald's own fate. <br> F. Scott Fitzgerald literally put his soul into <i>Tender Is the Night,</i> and the novel's lack of commercial success upon its initial publication in 1934 shattered him. He would die six years later without having published another novel, and without knowing that <i>Tender Is the Night</i> would come to be seen as perhaps its author's most poignant masterpiece. In Mabel Dodge Luhan's words, it raised him to the heights of "a modern Orpheus."</p><p>In the wake of World War I, a community of expatriate American writers established itself in the salons and cafes of 1920s Paris. They congregated at Gertrude Stein's select soirees, drank too much, married none too wisely, and wrote volumes--about the war, about the Jazz Age, and often about each other. F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, were part of this gang of literary Young Turks, and it was while living in France that Fitzgerald began writing <i>Tender Is the Night</i>. Begun in 1925, the novel was not actually published until 1934. By then, Fitzgerald was back in the States and his marriage was on the rocks, destroyed by Zelda's mental illness and alcoholism. Despite the modernist mandate to keep authors and their creations strictly segregated, it's difficult <i>not</i> to look for parallels between Fitzgerald's private life and the lives of his characters, psychiatrist Dick Diver and his former patient turned wife, Nicole. Certainly the hospital in Switzerland where Zelda was committed in 1929 provided the inspiration for the clinic where Diver meets, treats, and then marries the wealthy Nicole Warren. And Fitzgerald drew both the European locale and many of the characters from places and people he knew from abroad.<p> In the novel, Dick is eventually ruined--professionally, emotionally, and spiritually--by his union with Nicole. Fitzgerald's fate was not quite so novelistically neat: after Zelda was diagnosed as a schizophrenic and committed, Fitzgerald went to work as a Hollywood screenwriter in 1937 to pay her hospital bills. He died three years later--not melodramatically, like poor Jay Gatsby in his swimming pool, but prosaically, while eating a chocolate bar and reading a newspaper. Of all his novels, <i>Tender Is the Night</i> is arguably the one closest to his heart. As he himself wrote, "<i>Gatsby</i> was a tour de force, but this is a confession of faith."</p>In Tender Is The Night, Fitzgerald deliberately set out to write the most ambitious and far-reaching novel of his career, experimenting radically with narrative conventions of chronology and point of view and drawing on early breakthroughs in psychiatry to enrich his account of the makeup and breakdown of character and culture.</p><h2>Organic Chemistry Reactions (Quickstudy-Quick Reference Guide-Academic)</h2><p><p>The latest addition to our popular line of chemistry titles.

His process method--and its now commonplace "free writing" techniques--liberated generations of students and teachers from the emphasis on formal principles of grammar that had dominated composition pedagogy.<br><br>This new collection of essays brings together the best of Elbow's writing since the publication of <em>Embracing Contraries</em> in 1987. The volume includes sections on voice, the experience of writing, teaching, and evaluation. Implicit throughout is Elbow's commitment to humanizing the profession, and his continued emphasis on the importance of binary thinking and nonadversarial argument. The result is a compendium of a master teacher's thought on the relation between good pedagogy and good writing; it is sure to be of interest to all professional teachers of writing, and will be a valuable book for use in composition courses at all levels.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Elbow</strong> is Professor of English and Director of the writing program at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

But it includes other evidence as well&#x2014;sags and flaccidities, aches and pains, failing joints and organs. What are we to make of these tell-tale signs? Does growing old gracefully mean more than simply refusing unseemly cosmetic surgeries? How do we face decline and the final drawing of the blinds? Will we know if and when we have lingered too long?</p><p>Drawing on a lifetime of deep study and anxious observation, Miller enlists the wisdom of the ancients to confront these vexed questions head on. Debunking the glossy new image of old age that has accompanied the graying of the Baby Boomers, he conjures a lost world of aging rituals&#x2014;complaints, taking to bed, resentments of one&#x2019;s heirs, schemes for taking it with you or settling up accounts and scores&#x2014;to remind us of the ongoing dilemmas of old age.

Fashion can be seen as the practice of some of the most extreme strategies to conform to shifting concepts of the physical ideal. Various zones of the body&#x2015;the neck, the shoulders, the bust, the waist, the hips, and the feet&#x2015;have been constricted, padded, truncated, or extended through subtle visual adjustments of proportion, less subtle prosthesis, and, often, deliberate physical deformation.<br><br>This stunning book shows that an undeniable if uncanny beauty abides in the bundled cylindricality of a geisha tottering on raised <i>geta</i> or clogs; the tea-tray supporting bustle of an 1880s French visiting dress; the double-door expanse of eighteenth-century panniered court gowns; the bound feet and caged nails of aristocratic Manchu women; the neck-extending chokers of the Masai, of Edwardian beauties, and of John Galliano&#x2019;s designs for Dior; or the waist suppression of the sixteenth-century iron corsets and the cinches of early-nineteenth-century dandies. The photographs of fashion are augmented by paintings, prints, and drawings, including caricatures by Gilray, Cruikshank, Daumier, and Vernet.<br></p><p>Throughout history, humans have used clothing and accessories to lift, squeeze, frame and pad the body. In <i>Extreme Beauty: The Body Transformed</i>, Harold Koda deftly weaves anthropology, sociology, art history, and haute couture into a lively survey of shifting notions of the body beautiful. Divided into five sections--Neck and Shoulders, Chest, Waist, Hips, and Feet--the book surveys fashion's literal imprint on the body while tracing the history of clothing styles. The long neck may be the only bodily ideal equally prized by all cultures. Young Padaung women of Burma traditionally wore weighted brass coils that pushed down their collarbones and shoulders, creating the illusion of a remarkably long neck. The wide van Dyke lace collar achieved a similar "triangulated" shoulder-line in 17th-century Europe. Fashionable women in the 1830s relied on hugely inflated sleeves&#x2014;-held up with down-filled or wire-ribbed supports&#x2014;-to create the rounded dropped shoulder then in vogue. In the "Feet" section, Koda, who remains scrupulously nonjudgmental throughout, juxtaposes the miniaturized "Golden Lotus" bound foot of pre-Revolutionary China with the reshaping effect of today's stiletto heels. The platform shoe was another way of encumbering a woman's gait, whether as a way of keeping her at home (away from sexual temptation) or as a means of showing her off (the courtesans of Japan and Renaissance Venice perched on elevated soles). Men's body-altering fashions also get their due, from sculpted codpieces and male waist-binding to a front-padded shirt by Issey Miyake that resembles a baseball catcher's uniform. Koda's discussions of the historical allusions of avant-garde designers like Viktor and Rolf, Olivier Theyskens, and Hussein Chalayan vividly illuminate an often murky aspect of contemporary couture. Copiously illustrated with works of art and photographs of clothing and undergarments from many eras, <i>Extreme Beauty</i> packs a wealth of information into a slender volume. <i>&#x2014;-Cathy Curtis<i></i></i>Also available by Harold Koda: Goddess: The Classical Mode.

Preeminent researcher Dan P. McAdams traces the development of three distinct layers of personality--the social actor who expresses emotional and behavioral traits, the motivated agent who pursues goals and values, and the autobiographical author who constructs a personal story. Highly readable and accessible to scholars and students at all levels, the book uses rich portraits of the lives of famous people to illustrate theoretical concepts and empirical findings.<br><br> See also the <i>Handbook of Personality Development</i>, edited by Dan P. McAdams, Rebecca L. Shiner, and Jennifer L. Tackett.</p><p>Dan P. McAdams, PhD, is the Henry Wade Rogers Professor of Psychology and Human Development at Northwestern University. He is President and a founding member of the Association for Research in Personality;&nbsp;a Fellow of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology (SPSP, Division 8 of the American Psychological Association) and the American Psychological Society; and a former member of&nbsp;the Executive Committee of SPSP. Dr. McAdams works in the areas of personality and lifespan developmental psychology. His research focuses on concepts of self and identity in contemporary American society and on themes of power, intimacy, redemption, and generativity across the adult life course. He has published over 200 scientific articles and chapters and numerous books."This fascinating book presents an integrative 'big picture' of personality development from the earliest days of life through old age. McAdams strikes a great balance between theory and empiricism; he articulates a broad theoretical model of personality development that is informed at every point by contemporary research. The book is beautifully written, remarkably clear, and thoroughly engaging. The case studies, tables, and figures draw the reader in and illustrate how complex and interesting the emergence of personality is. The book will be of great use to researchers from a variety of fields, as well as undergraduates and graduate students."--Rebecca L. Shiner, PhD, Department of Psychology, Colgate University<br><br> "This is a powerful book that succeeds on two levels. First, it communicates how personality research is done and how researchers arrive at scientifically defensible answers to questions about human nature. Second, it invites readers to introspect--to ask themselves how they came to be who they are. The book is broad and deep. Like the best of teachers, it is intellectually satisfying and great fun!"--Avshalom Caspi, PhD, Edward M. Arnett Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University<br><br> "<i>The Art and Science of Personality Development</i> is a landmark achievement in an already illustrious career. This volume heralds the first comprehensive theory of personality development to emerge in the 21st century. While demonstrating a breathtaking grasp of research in neuroscience, traits, motives, goals, and narrative identity, McAdams writes in a lucid and accessible manner. This combination makes this book the ideal text for both undergraduates and more advanced students. It should be required reading for any student or scholar interested in how human personality develops and changes over the course of our lives."--Jefferson A. Singer, PhD, Dean of the College and Faulk Foundation Professor of Psychology, Connecticut College<br><br> "The most comprehensive and integrated overview of personality development currently available. I was eager to adopt this text for my graduate Human Development course, and it exceeded expectations. I love this book because of its deft coverage of the most important issues in personality development. My students unanimously praised McAdams's ability to provide a compelling narrative of the current research. If you are looking to illustrate to students why personality development is so important to understanding who we are, this is the text for you."--Paul W. Griffin, PhD, Department of Psychology, Pace University &nbsp;<br><br>"By merging personality research and a developmental perspective, McAdams invites readers on a journey of understanding who people come to know themselves to be at all phases of life....This book will be particularly useful for professionals/practitioners working with individuals struggling with issues of identity and/or personality.

In addition, there is a generous sampling from <b>Ulysses</b> and <b>Finnegans Wake</b>, including the famous "<b>Anna Livia Plurabelle</b>" episode.</p><p><b>James Joyce</b>, the twentieth century&#x2019;s most influential novelist, was born in Dublin on February 2, 1882. The oldest of ten children, he grew up in a family that went from prosperity to penury because of his father&#x2019;s wastrel behavior. After receiving a rigorous Jesuit education, twenty-year-old Joyce renounced his Catholicism and left Dublin in 1902 to spend most of his life as a writer in exile in Paris, Trieste, Rome, and Zurich. On one trip back to Ireland, he fell in love with the now famous Nora Barnacle on June 16, the day he later chose as &#x201c;Bloomsday&#x201d; in his novel&nbsp;<i>Ulysses.&nbsp;</i>Nora was an uneducated Galway girl who became his lifelong companion and the mother of his two children. In debt and drinking heavily, Joyce lived for 36 years on the Continent, supporting himself first by teaching jobs, then through the patronage of Mrs. Harold McCormick (Edith Rockerfeller) and the English feminist and editor Harriet Shaw Weaver. His writings include&nbsp;<i>Chamber Music&nbsp;</i>(1907),&nbsp;<i>Dubliners&nbsp;</i>(1914),&nbsp;<i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&nbsp;</i>(1916),&nbsp;<i>Exiles&nbsp;</i>(1918),&nbsp;<i>Ulysses&nbsp;</i>(1922),&nbsp;<i>Pomes Penyeach&nbsp;</i>(1927),&nbsp;<i>Finnegan's Wake&nbsp;</i>(1939), and an early draft of&nbsp;<i>A Portrait of a Young Man, Stephan Hero&nbsp;</i>(1944).&nbsp;<i>Ulysses&nbsp;</i>required seven years to complete, and his masterpiece,&nbsp;<i>Finnegan's Wake,&nbsp;</i>took seventeen.

Most contemporary social scientists unconsciously take a "snapshot" view of the social world. Yet the meaning of social events or processes is frequently distorted when they are ripped from their temporal context. Paul Pierson argues that placing politics in time--constructing "moving pictures" rather than snapshots--can vastly enrich our understanding of complex social dynamics, and greatly improve the theories and methods that we use to explain them.</p><br><br><p> <i>Politics in Time</i> opens a new window on the temporal aspects of the social world. It explores a range of important features and implications of evolving social processes: the variety of processes that unfold over significant periods of time, the circumstances under which such different processes are likely to occur, and above all, the significance of these temporal dimensions of social life for our understanding of important political and social outcomes. Ranging widely across the social sciences, Pierson's analysis reveals the high price social science pays when it becomes ahistorical. And it provides a wealth of ideas for restoring our sense of historical process. By placing politics back in time, Pierson's book is destined to have a resounding and enduring impact on the work of scholars and students in fields from political science, history, and sociology to economics and policy analysis.</p></p><p><p>"Every once in a long while a book comes along that shifts the debate entirely by altering the vantage point from which we approach the study of politics. This is such a book. Maneuvering masterfully across diverse literatures and drawing on an extraordinary range of empirical cases, Pierson identifies key mechanisms that give meaning and precision to the abstract claim that history matters. Through analysis and illustration, he provides new insights into exactly how, when, and why this is true. This is an enormously important and agenda-setting work."<b>--Kathleen Thelen, Northwestern University</b></p><p>"Paul Pierson is a leading voice in new social science debates on<br>temporality and path dependence. He has now taken a major step forward by unifying his arguments in an integrated statement. This book will be indispensable for scholars across several disciplines who are concerned with comparative-historical analysis, innovative perspectives on causal assessment, and integrative approaches that bridge qualitative and quantitative methods."<b>---David Collier, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"<i>Politics in Time</i> is a splendid book that will shape debates in political science and beyond for many years to come. It represents the most systematic and thorough statement on theorizing temporal processes in the social sciences ever written. Pierson sets new agendas by challenging researchers to take time seriously, especially those who work in analytic traditions that traditionally have been relatively atemporal."<b>--James Mahoney, Brown University, author of <i>The Legacies of Liberalism</i></b></p><b>Paul Pierson</b> is Harold Hitchings Burbank Professor of Political Economy at Harvard University.

The text stresses the application of mathematics to problem solving rather than derivation of theory. Numerous case studies cultivate student understanding of the occurrence and movement of ground water in a variety of geologic settings.PREFACE <p> Hydrogeology is now considered to be a core course in the curriculum of undergraduate geology programs as well as many fields of engineering. There is ongoing demand for persons with training in hydrogeology by consulting organizations, state and federal regulatory agencies, and industrial firms. Most of the employment in hydrogeology is in the environmental area. This is a book that will help prepare students for either a career in hydrogeology or in other areas of environmental science and engineering where a strong background in hydrogeology is needed. </p><p> Applied Hydrogeology is intended as a textbook for an introductory course in hydrogeology taught either at the advanced undergraduate level, or as a dual-level undergraduate/graduate course. It is also useful in helping individuals who are preparing to take state examinations for professional registration as a hydrologist or hydrogeologist. It can be found as a reference book in the personal library of many working professionals. </p><p> The reader is expected to have a working knowledge of college algebra, and calculus is helpful, but not necessary, for practical understanding of the material. A background in college chemistry is necessary to understand the chapter on water chemistry. The book stresses the application of mathematics to problem-solving rather than the derivation of theory. To this end you will find many example problems with step-by-step solutions. Case studies in many chapters enhance understanding of the occurrence and movement of ground water in a variety of geological settings. A glossary of hydrogeological terms makes this book a valuable reference. </p><p> The fourth edition contains new case studies and end-of-chapter problems. In most cases the problems are paired. An odd-numbered problem will have the answer given in a section in the back of the book, followed by an even-numbered problem without the answer. Step-by-step solutions to the odd-numbered problems can also be found at the Applied Hydrogeology web page: appliedhydrogeology. Many chapters in the fourth edition also contain a section called Analysis, with non-numerical questions. The use of spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft� Excel, in hydrogeology is introduced here. </p><p> Included with the text are working student versions of three computer programs that are used by ground-water professionals. They have been furnished free of charge by the software publishers. No technical support is furnished for these programs, either by the author or the software publisher. However, they are easy to use and come with tutorials and documentation on the CD-ROM. </p><p> The following reviewers provided helpful suggestions for the fourth edition: Gary S.

In this engrossing expos�, Marion Nestle goes behind the scenes to reveal how the competition really works and how it affects our health. The abundance of food in the United States--enough calories to meet the needs of every man, woman, and child twice over--has a downside. Our over-efficient food industry must do everything possible to persuade people to eat <i>more</i>--more food, more often, and in larger portions--no matter what it does to waistlines or well-being. <br><br>Like manufacturing cigarettes or building weapons, making food is big business. Food companies in 2000 generated nearly $900 billion in sales. They have stakeholders to please, shareholders to satisfy, and government regulations to deal with. It is nevertheless shocking to learn precisely how food companies lobby officials, co-opt experts, and expand sales by marketing to children, members of minority groups, and people in developing countries. We learn that the food industry plays politics as well as or better than other industries, not least because so much of its activity takes place outside the public view. <br><br>Editor of the 1988 <i>Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health, </i>Nestle is uniquely qualified to lead us through the maze of food industry interests and influences. She vividly illustrates food politics in action: watered-down government dietary advice, schools pushing soft drinks, diet supplements promoted as if they were First Amendment rights. When it comes to the mass production and consumption of food, strategic decisions are driven by economics--not science, not common sense, and certainly not health. No wonder most of us are thoroughly confused about what to eat to stay healthy.<br><br>An accessible and balanced account, <i>Food Politics </i>will forever change the way we respond to food industry marketing practices. By explaining how much the food industry influences government nutrition policies and how cleverly it links its interests to those of nutrition experts, this path-breaking book helps us understand more clearly than ever before what we eat and why.</p><p>"In this fascinating book we learn how powerful, intrusive, influential, and invasive big industry is and how alert we must constantly be to prevent it from influencing not only our own personal nutritional choices, but those of our government agencies. Marion Nestle has presented us with a courageous and masterful expos�."&#x2015;Julia Child<br><br>"This remarkable book is essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand how it has come to be that the richest nation in the world is eating itself to death.... Straight reporting about the shaping of food policy, as this volume makes clear, is certain to offend some very powerful players."&#x2015;Joan Dye Gussow, author of <i>This Organic Life</i><br><br>"Food politics underlie all politics in the United States. There is no industry more important to Americans, more fundamentally linked to our well-being and the future well-being of our children. Nestle reveals how corporate control of the nation's food system limits our choices and threatens our health. If you eat, you should read this book."&#x2015;Eric Schlosser, author of <i>Fast Food Nation </i><br><br>"'Blockbuster' is one of the best ways that I could describe this book.... A major contribution to understanding the interaction of politics and science, especially the science of nutrition, it is of extreme value to virtually all policy makers and to everyone concerned with the American diet."&#x2015;Sheldon Margen, editor of the <i>Berkeley Wellness Letter </i><br><br>"A devastating analysis of how the naked self-interest of America's largest industry influences and compromises nutrition policy and government regulation of food safety. . . . A clear translation of often obscure studies and cases, the writing is accessible and lively."&#x2015;Warren Belasco, author of <i>Appetite for Change </i><b>Marion Nestle</b> is Professor and Chair of the Department of Nutrition and Food Studies at New York University. Author of Nutrition in Clinical Practice (1985), she has served as a nutrition policy advisor to the Department of Health and Human Services and as a member of nutrition and science advisory committees to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration.

Krynski and Robert A. Maguire Regarded as one of the best representatives since World War II of the rich and ancient art of poetry in Poland, Wislawa Szymborska (1923-2012) is, in the translators' words, "that rarest of phenomena: a serious poet who commands a large audience in her native land." The seventy poems in this bilingual edition are among the largest and most representative offering of her work in English, with particular emphasis on the period since 1967. They illustrate virtually all her major themes and most of her important techniques.</p><br><p> Describing Szymborka's poetry, Magnus Krynski and Robert Maguire write that her verse is marked by high seriousness, delightful inventiveness, a prodigal imagination, and enormous technical skill. She writes of the diversity, plenitude, and richness of the world, taking delight in observing and naming its phenomena. She looks on with wonder, astonishment, and amusement, but almost never with despair.</p></p><p>Text: English, Polish (translation)"This volume reveals a poet of startling originality and deep sympathy," said LJ's reviewer of this 1981 collection of 70 poems by the then relatively unknown Polish poet who has now won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Though the poems deal with loss, "hers is not a voice of despair, but one capable of balancing loss with wonder" (LJ 9/1/81).<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Reason and Religious Belief: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion</h2><p>A favorite at a wide range of colleges and universities nation-wide, this comprehensive introduction to the philosophy of religion examines all the standard topics as well as new issues such as Reformed epistemology, the philosophical analysis of theological doctrine, and the Kalam<br>cosmological argument. Special attention is given to important subjects not often considered in other introductions, such as process theism, religious pluralism, and the relation of religion and morality. Each chapter begins with a concrete example or situation to draw students into thinking about<br>the particular issue and to encourage them to come to their own conclusions. Each chapter includes study questions and a list of suggested readings. Focusing mainly on issues surrounding classical theism, the book also deals where helpful with issues related specifically to Judeo-Christian theism<br>and to non-Western traditions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, making it especially well-rounded.</p><p>Michael Peterson, Professor of Philosophy, Asbury College.

These essays, collected from professional journals, represent some of the best experimental teaching done to adapt Freire's liberatory pedagogy to North American classrooms.

She proposes a distinctively feminist curiosity that begins with taking women seriously, especially during this era of unprecedented American influence. This means listening carefully, digging deep, challenging assumptions, and welcoming surprises. Listening to women in Asian sneaker factories, Enloe reveals, enables us to bring down to earth the often abstract discussions of the global economy. Paying close attention to Iraqi women's organizing efforts under military occupation exposes the false global promises made by officials. Enloe also turns the beam of her inquiry inward. In a series of four candid interviews and a new set of autobiographical pieces, she reflects on the gradual development of her own feminist curiosity. Describing her wartime suburban girlhood and her years at Berkeley, she maps the everyday obstacles placed on the path to feminist consciousness&#x2015;and suggests how those obstacles can be identified and overcome. <br><br><i>The Curious Feminist </i>shows how taking women seriously also challenges the common assumption that masculinities are trivial factors in today's international affairs. Enloe explores the workings of masculinity inside organizations as diverse as the American military, a Serbian militia, the UN, and Oxfam. A feminist curiosity finds all women worth thinking about, Enloe claims. She suggests that we pay thoughtful attention to women who appear complicit in violence or in the oppression of others, or too cozily wrapped up in their relative privilege to inspire praise or compassion. Enloe's vitality, passion, and incisive wit illuminate each essay. <i>The Curious Feminist </i>is an original and timely invitation to look at global politics in an entirely different way.</p><p>"The book is a sensitive gendered analysis of interlocking developments from globalized economic markets to war and post-conflict dynamics. While Enloe's book brings out the complexities of women's positions in a very immediate way as they play out in large scale platforms of power, survival, politics, and profit, she also convincingly shows the links between and importance of women's everyday lives."&#x2015;Carolyn Nordstrom, author of <i>Shadows of War: Violence, War, and International Profiteering in the Twenty-First Century</i><br><br>"With an unwavering gender optic Cynthia Enloe examines a number of themes and issues bearing on what a feminist curiosity can show you in international relations and political studies. Throughout this collection of essays, Enloe both articulates and exemplifies her philosophy that knowledge comes out of ordinary people's experiences, and that it's important to pay attention to what the marginal and silent can tell us."&#x2015;Cynthia Cockburn, author of <i>The Space Between Us: Negotiating Gender and National Identities in Conflict</i><br><br>"Enloe's knack of laying out simply the tangled webs of connection that link the poor and the rich, the marginal and the privileged, masculine enterprise and female exploitation, is unsurpassed. This is feminist scholarship at its very, very best: fresh, lively, uncompromising and tremendously readable."&#x2015;Philippa Levine, author of <i>Prostitution, Race and Politics: Policing Venereal Disease in the British Empire</i><br><br>"Brilliant, funny, and energizing, these essays take us on a whirlwind and solidarity-building tour of the world of women today. En route, Enloe reveals the intellectual and political benefits of being relentlessly curious, open-minded, and humble. The confidence of the powerful and the naturalness of a world with men in charge will not seem the same after reading this book.&#x201d;&#x2015;Catherine Lutz, author of <i>Homefront: A Military City and the American 20th Century</i><br><br>"At the heart of this book is a challenge to patriarchal systems that privilege masculinity and marginalize critical feminist voices. Enloe encourages all of us to consider not just what we study, but how we study the world in this new age of empire and to pay attention to not just the powerful, but to 'the bottom rungs'."&#x2015;Steven Lamy, Director, School of International Relations, University of Southern California<b>Cynthia Enloe</b> is Research Professor of Women's Studies and International Development at Clark University.

The project had a broad aim - to identify the relationship between language and reality and to define the limits of science - and is recognized as a significant philosophical work of the twentieth century. Wittgenstein wrote the notes for the Tractatus while he was a soldier during World War I and completed it when a prisoner of war at Como and later Cassino in August 1918. It was first published in German in 1921 as &#39;Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung&#39;. The Tractatus was influential chiefly amongst the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle, such as Rudolf Carnap and Friedrich Waismann. Bertrand Russell&#39;s article &#34;The Philosophy of Logical Atomism&#34; is presented as a working out of ideas that he had learned from Wittgenstein.</p><p></p><h2>The Business of Massage Therapy: Building a Successful Career</h2><p><p> </p><p> </p>This is the premiere guide to managing a successful massage career and running a successful holistic business.

It also includes vital information on marketing and the Internet: knowledge often absent in the high-touch, low-tech world of massage.

The mild-mannered bank clerk with the short attention span and vivid imagination has inspired, charmed, and informed young and old alike since the publication of the hugely successful Mr Tompkins in Paperback (by George Gamow) in 1965. Now, this highly affable character returns to embark on a set of adventures that explore the extreme edges of the universe--the smallest, the largest, the fastest, and the farthest. Just by following the experiences and dreams of Mr. Tompkins, readers discover and come to know the merry dance of cosmic mysteries, including: Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity, bizarre effects near light-speed, the birth and death of the universe, black holes, quarks, space warps and antimatter, the fuzzy world of the quantum, and that ultimate cosmic mystery--love. The story of Mr. Tompkins&#39; journey to the frontiers of modern physics will delight and inform all readers.

He is now back in a set of adventures exploring the extreme edges of the universe--the smallest, the largest, the fastest, the farthest. This new text is revised, updated and expanded by best-selling popular-science author Russell Stannard (author of the much-acclaimed Uncle Albert series of books for children).George Gamow (1904 to 1968) was not only one of the most influential physicists of the twentieth century (one of the founders of the Big Bang theory) but was also a master at science popularisation. Of his many popular books, the best known is Mr Tompkins in Paperback (1965).<br><br>Russell Stannard has established a reputation as one of the most gifted popularisers of science through numerous media appearances and projects, and in particular for his Uncle Albert Trilogy (The Time and Space of Uncle Albert, Black Holes and Uncle Albert and the Quantum Quest), which covers the work of Albert Einstein and quantum theory in a way that is accessible to children of 11+.

Through his experiments with the neo- avant-gardes in 1963, his editorship of Casabella from 1982 to 1995, and his teaching, practice, and writing, Gregotti&#39;s voice has influenced almost every recent architectural debate. Inside Architecture, his first major work to be translated into English, balances a series of architectual themes concerning the theoretical debate surrounding modernism and tradition with the more practical affairs of the architect. Gregotti first identifies the elements of mass culture and public institutions that have led to the deterioration of natural and man-made environments. He then investigates eight issues - precision, technique, monumentality, modification, atopia, simplicity, procedure, and image - that influence the activities of contemporary architects. Gregotti is particularly suspicious of the deconstructivist argument and its heavy reliance on literary models. And he provides an incisive critique of the recent interest in modernist aesthetics, warning against reviving the forms of an old movement without considering the cultural and social criteria that once gave it purpose and meaning.

She promptly built an empire of trading ships, furs, and real estate that included all of Westchester County.

She promptly built an empire: Her fleet of trading ships carried furs, molasses, and slaves around the globe and her real estate holdings stretched from Albany to Barbados. Women like her were known as "she-merchants," and Margaret rose to become the wealthiest in the colony, while also raising five children and keeping a spotless linen closet.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a bold, vivid narrative that challenges all our assumptions about colonial women, Zimmerman traces the astonishing rise of Margaret and the Philipse women who followed her, who would transform Margaret's storehouse on the banks of the Hudson into a stately mansion called Philipse Manor Hall that still stands today. In sensual, gritty detail she animates the New York frontier these four very well-off women inhabited, taking us into the birthing chambers, genteel parlors, rowdy Manhattan markets and cramped decks of transatlantic ships where they lived their everyday trials and extraordinary triumphs.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a rich trove of unmined primary sources and a novelist&#x2019;s flair for storytelling, Zimmerman gives a forgotten group of our foremothers a place at the colonial table.</p><h2>Denim: Fashion&#39;s Frontier</h2><p><b>A wide-ranging and beautifully illustrated history of the fashion associated with the world&#x2019;s most ubiquitous fabric</b><br><br> Denim is one of the world&#x2019;s favorite fabrics, and today it accounts for the largest segment of the clothing industry.&nbsp; The market for jeans alone is worth over 55 billion dollars. Experiments with denim by designers have helped to develop a vast vocabulary of denim styles beyond jeans that are now ingrained in fashion&#x2019;s lexicon.&nbsp; This handsome book explores the multifaceted history of denim and examines the continually evolving relationship between it and high fashion.<br> &nbsp;<br> Prized for its durability and strength, denim began as an ideal fabric for workwear, most famously in the clothing produced by Levi Strauss &amp; Co. for fortune hunters during the 19th-century California gold rush.&nbsp; Over the past 160 years, however, film, television, and advertising have helped transform denim into a symbol of youth, rebellion, sex, and the ever-ephemeral quality of &#x201c;cool.&#x201d; The fashion industry has also played a large role in the expansion of denim into casual and couture clothing. The Denim Council, which formed in the U.S. in the 1950s, promoted denim to an ever-widening circle of customers through the framework of the fashion industry, most notably with presentations during New York fashion weeks.&nbsp; Featuring previously unpublished archival material from the Denim Council, an insightful text, and copious illustrations, this book offers a new perspective on denim&#x2019;s rapid rise from the 19th century to today.</p><p><b>Emma McClendon </b>is assistant curator and <b>Fred Dennis </b>is senior curator, both at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, New York.</p><h2>Death of Anton (British Library Crime Classics)</h2><p><p><strong>Mystery crime fiction written in the Golden Age of Murder</strong></p><p>"Readers in search of escapist entertainment need look no further." &#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p><p><strong>'There's more crime going on in Carey's Circus than in the whole underworld of London.

Indeed, for the last fifty years, most popular and scholarly works have agreed that prehistoric warfare was rare, harmless, unimportant, and, like smallpox, a disease of civilized societies alone. Prehistoric warfare, according to this view, was little more than a ritualized game, where casualties were limited and the effects of aggression relatively mild. Lawrence Keeley's groundbreaking <em>War Before Civilization</em> offers a devastating rebuttal to such comfortable myths and debunks the notion that warfare was introduced to primitive societies through contact with civilization (an idea he denounces as "the pacification of the past").<br> Building on much fascinating archeological and historical research and offering an astute comparison of warfare in civilized and prehistoric societies, from modern European states to the Plains Indians of North America, <em>War Before Civilization</em> convincingly demonstrates that prehistoric warfare was in fact more deadly, more frequent, and more ruthless than modern war. To support this point, Keeley provides a wide-ranging look at warfare and brutality in the prehistoric world. He reveals, for instance, that prehistorical tactics favoring raids and ambushes, as opposed to formal battles, often yielded a high death-rate; that adult males falling into the hands of their enemies were almost universally killed; and that surprise raids seldom spared even women and children. Keeley cites evidence of ancient massacres in many areas of the world, including the discovery in South Dakota of a prehistoric mass grave containing the remains of over 500 scalped and mutilated men, women, and children (a slaughter that took place a century and a half before the arrival of Columbus). In addition, Keeley surveys the prevalence of looting, destruction, and trophy-taking in all kinds of warfare and again finds little moral distinction between ancient warriors and civilized armies. Finally, and perhaps most controversially, he examines the evidence of cannibalism among some preliterate peoples.<br> Keeley is a seasoned writer and his book is packed with vivid, eye-opening details (for instance, that the homicide rate of prehistoric Illinois villagers may have exceeded that of the modern United States by some 70 times). But he also goes beyond grisly facts to address the larger moral and philosophical issues raised by his work. What are the causes of war? Are human beings inherently violent? How can we ensure peace in our own time? Challenging some of our most dearly held beliefs, Keeley's conclusions are bound to stir controversy.<br></p><p>Throughout much of this century the notion has been gaining ground, bolstered by genocide and Holocaust, that modern warfare is more barbaric than war has ever been. Alongside this view has grown a romantic impression that primitive cultures were, and are, more peaceful. Lawrence Keeley, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois, aims to dispel this inversion of the connotations of &#34;civilization.&#34; He cites the historical evidence that humans have always been just as bloodthirsty as they are today, and that indeed in the days when death was less clinical it was often nastier. War, it seems, has always been with us.<br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Lawrence H. Keeley</strong> is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Drawing on historical episodes ranging from antiquity to the recent past, and combining them with literary examples and personal reflections, Teofilo Ruiz explores the embrace of religious experiences, the pursuit of worldly success and pleasures, and the quest for beauty and knowledge as three primary responses to the individual and collective nightmares of history. The result is a profound meditation on how men and women in Western society sought (and still seek) to make meaning of the world and its disturbing history.</p><br><p> In chapters that range widely across Western history and culture, <i>The Terror of History</i> takes up religion, the material world, and the world of art and knowledge. "Religion and the World to Come" examines orthodox and heterodox forms of spirituality, apocalyptic movements, mysticism, supernatural beliefs, and many forms of esotericism, including magic, alchemy, astrology, and witchcraft. "The World of Matter and the Senses" considers material riches, festivals and carnivals, sports, sex, and utopian communities. Finally, "The Lure of Beauty and Knowledge" looks at cultural productions of all sorts, from art to scholarship.</p><br><p> Combining astonishing historical breadth with a personal and accessible narrative style, <i>The Terror of History</i> is a moving testimony to the incredibly diverse ways humans have sought to cope with their frightening history.</p></p><p><br><p>"This is a beautifully written and deeply personal meditation on the horrors of Western history. A senior historian with an existential sensibility, Ruiz is keenly attuned to the terrors lurking in our awareness of time's relentless passing. Reflecting on our individual and collective reactions to disaster, disease, war, and death, Ruiz explores the different ways humans respond to the abysses of history by finding or creating meaning.<i>The Terror of History</i> is an enlightening and heartfelt work."<b>--Iain Thomson, University of New Mexico</b><br></p><br><p>"Very few books dig so deeply into the feelings and experiences that really drive historians.

Were the carefully placed stones a burial site, an ancient calendar, a place of Druid worship...or even a site of sacrifice? World-renowned archaeologist Mike Parker-Pearson has spent the last seven years on a quest to answer these and many other questions. In <i>If Stones Could Speak, </i>award-winning author Marc Aronson joins the research crew and records their efforts to crack Stonehenge&#x2019;s secrets. National Geographic helped sponsor the Riverside archeological team&#x2019;s mission, and now young readers can journey behind the scenes to experience this groundbreaking story first-hand, through the eyes of the experts. <br><br>Mike and his team have revolutionized our understanding of Stonehenge by exploring the surrounding landscape for clues about the stones -- an idea first suggested by a visitor from Madagascar. The results have been breathtaking: The team recently unearthed the largest Neolithic village ever found in England. Marc Aronson had total access to the site, the team, and their work over two seasons of digging and brings the inspirational story of the discoveries taking place at this World Historical Site to young readers. The informative and drama-driven text includes tales of dead bodies, cremations, feasting, and ancient rituals, as well as insights into the science of uncovering the ancien t past. <br><br>The expert text, stunning photography, and explanatory maps and illustrations will all help young readers see this ancient monument in totally new ways, and inspire future generations of archaeological explorers.</p><p>Marc Aronson is an award-winning author and editor. He lives in Maplewood, NJ.Starred Review. Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;This title is not just an examination of recent breakthroughs at Stonehenge, but rather an essay on the process of archaeology and a hopeful reminder to future archaeologists that all the great sites are not yet dug or fully understood. In 2005, the Riverside Project, led by Mike Parker Pearson, made several significant discoveries that placed Stonehenge within a much larger Neolithic complex. Pearson began with a hypothesis, suggested by a retired archaeologist from Madagascar, that, as in Madagascar, the stone of Stonehenge was to honor ancestors and the dead, and that there would be a sister complex made of wood for the living. This idea was radically different from the previously accepted theory of Stonehenge being used as a temple. The ongoing work of the Riverside Project has revised the long-accepted dates of when Stonehenge was built and found much to support Pearson's hypothesis. Aronson writes in a casual style and addresses readers directly, which effectively conveys the excitement of this research, although it does occasionally assume some background knowledge that seems unlikely. The story of how Pearson became involved in archaeology and came to work at Stonehenge gets nearly as much attention as the work currently being done there and underscores one of Aronson's central themes&#x2014;that we are constantly adding to our understanding of the past. Large, colorful photographs complement the text and several shots capture what archaeology-in-progress looks like. A useful, attractive, and highly readable book.&#x2014;<i>Caroline Tesauro, Radford Public Library, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In quest of these desired products and the income they brought, explorers ventured forth, risking death as they traveled unknown seas. Here is the story of seven plants--tobacco, sugar, cotton, tea, poppies, quinine, and rubber--and how Europe's hunger for them led to the Age of Empire...and turned world history upside down. Not only did these crops ensure the commercial success of America and Europe, but they became the catalyst for piracy, smuggling, addiction, and the slave trade--the darker side of the golden profits. With fascinating contemporary illustrations.<br></p><p>Dr Toby Musgrave is a garden designer and historian, with keen interest in the social aspects of economic botany.

Co-author of The Plant Hunters, he is also fascinated by Minoan civilisation and is currently working on a novel set in ancient Crete.In the sweeping tradition of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, plant historians Toby and Will Musgrave (The Plant Hunters) present An Empire of Plants: People and Plants That Changed the World. They track human use of seven plants tea, tobacco, sugar, opium, cotton, quinine and rubber across centuries and continents. With brief "profiles" of each plant separated from the main text, sidebars about kinds of tea malaria or historical "Opinions on the Opium Trade," and dozens of illustrations and photos, it's a fun, glossy textbook for adults, rigorous and scholarly while catering to the amateur historian. The Musgraves' depictions of the plants' effects and permutations in industry, slavery, drug use and trade the world over and down the ages are stark and fascinating. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Wiggle, Giggle &amp; Shake: Over 200 Ways to Move and Learn</h2><p>Enhance your classroom with 200 movement-inspiring activities for children ages 4 to 8.

Oh Quebec! : Requiem for a Divided Country</h2><p>Good; has some light wear creases in spine.</p><p>Quebec-born Richler (Solomon Gursky Was Here, 1990, etc.) undertakes a backgrounder to that province's independence movement, with several large flashes of illuminating absurdity about the passionate Quebecois. A referendum will be held this October to determine whether Quebec should ask for independence from Canada. The province has already added a raft of debatable laws to its books, such as one that forbids English-language or bilingual commercial signs on Montreal's streets. Today, Richler tells us, wary shopkeepers welcome customers ``in a fail-safe combination of English and French, singing out, `Hi, bonjour.' '' Moreover, zealots who run Montreal's French Catholic school board shocked even separatists ``with a demand that immigrant students who were caught shooting the breeze in English in the schoolyards should be severely punished.'' And so it goes, with even intellectual Francophones as blinkered and narrow-minded as peasants in a Marcel Pagnol comedy. Actually, Richler explains, 40 percent of Canadians are of neither French nor English extraction; they are of Polish, Greek, Ukrainian, and Italian descent, with growing Chinese, Sikh, African, and Central American enclaves, who will soon form a majority of Canada's populace. Richler also laments Canada's ``functional but nondescript'' cities, the demolition of its oldest buildings and their replacement by entrenched ugliness of ``the utmost banality.'' He offers a lively description of the Mohawk Indians' uprising against the incursion of a golf course into their burial grounds--an uprising that forced a mortified Quebec to call in the Canadian army--and he sees independence as diminishing Quebec into ``being a folkloric society. A place that people come from. Ireland without that country's genius or terrible beauty.'' Unlike most of Richler, largely for Canadians; for a look at Canada that's more accessible to those south of the border, try Jan Morris's O Canada (p. 307). -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Novelist-screenwriter Richler, a native of Montreal, predicts a mass exodus of English speakers if a majority of Quebecers opt for independence from Canada in an October 1992 referendum, creating a separate, debt-ridden, predominantly French-speaking nation. If the separatists win, it will be a sad day for Canada, he asserts in this scathing critique of the Francophone Quebecois nationalist movement. Far from being oppressed, he declares, the French-speaking Quebecers constitute a privileged, xenophobic group that promotes divisiveness and imposes absurdly restrictive laws designed to preserve French as the language of the workplace and public discourse. Recalling his upbringing in a working-class Jewish community, Richler charges that from its inception French-Canadian nationalism has been tainted by racism and anti-Semitism. This is a profound, disturbing look at a crisis that could give birth to the world's 18th-largest country.

Rather than a galactic vision of war and peace, this novel is localized in the extreme: the plot revolves around Heather, a psychology professor struggling to decipher extraterrestrial messages, and her estranged husband, Kyle, on the brink of the biggest computer science breakthrough of all time. What makes <i>Factoring Humanity</i> work is that Sawyer deals with vast ideas such as alien contact, quantum mechanics, and the human overmind, but does so to a deeply personal effect.<p> Sawyer, like many writers of near-future science fiction, has an unfortunate tendency to be too rooted in today, to make so many casual references to our present that they draw undue attention to themselves, making it difficult for the reader to suspend disbelief. This fascination with 20th-century pop culture crowds the real story and real details into a corner and underscores an apparent lack of creativity in painting future landscapes. Otherwise, and forgiving Sawyer's breathtakingly myopic view of Native Canadians and rather bland prose, this is exciting, readable science fiction that will take you where no one has gone before--and you'll never forget the ending. <i>--Jhana Bach</i></p><p><b>Robert J.

Intended for use in one- or two-semester courses on Schenkerian theory, this text will also appeal to individuals interested in Schenker's work. The book assumes no prior knowledge of the subject, but it does require a background in harmony and voice leading; a familiarity with species counterpoint is also desirable. The authors develop Schenkerian techniques through the practical analysis of specific compositions, an approach that parallels the evolution of Schenker's work. The book explains structural principles in actual composition rather than through models and formulas, and teaches students how to think about and critically examine compositions in ways that will inform their understanding and performance of great compositions of Western art music.<br> The first part of the volume provides the foundation for the analysis of complete pieces and includes discussions of melody, counterpoint, bass-line structures, the Imaginary Continuo, linear techniques, and the essential properties of the <em>Ursatz</em> and its elaborations; the presentation of complete compositions in Part II is organized by formal category. The revised concluding chapter summarizes many of the general tonal patterns that recur throughout the literature.

The reader will explore each stage of the journey and look at the myths and fairy tales that shed light on these archetypal experiences: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Separation from the Feminine, in which a woman searches for an identity in a masculine-defined culture. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The Road of Trials, in which she challenges the myths of female inferiority, dependency, and romantic love. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Spiritual Aridity, a feeling of having lost herself in her struggle for achievement. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Initiation and Descent, a period of drawing inward and looking for the lost pieces of herself. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Urgent yearning to reconnect with the Feminine and heal the Mother-Daughter Split. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Integrating and healing the wounded parts of her inner Masculine. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The Sacred Marriage, which occurs as she learns to integrate and balance all aspects of herself.<br>The chapters include questions for reflection as well as exercises in guided imagery, writing, art, and dreamwork to bring clarity and understanding to the quest. Finally, the skills learned on this archetypal journey prepare a woman to work toward the larger quest of bringing consciousness to others and preserving the balance of life on earth.</p><p>Maureen Murdock is a licensed family therapist in private practice in Venice, California, and teaches in the UCLA Extension Writer's Program.

My first jolt came while addressing the author's initial "Question for . . . Reflection," which was, "Who are the heroines in your life . . .?" I could have reeled off a whole list of heroes, but even one heroine was a stretch. There's message enough in that, yes? We'd better get working! And this workbook is a great tool, for individuals or for groups. Skillful prompting and multiple techniques guide readers through various stages of recognition, acceptance, healing, and integration of the feminine.

Whatever the occasion--and her work offers a rich profusion of them--the poems reach to where possession is not within us, where new names are needed and meaning enlarged. Hence, what she sees reminds her of what is missing, and what she knows suggests what she cannot. From any event, she arcs bravely into the farthest reaches of mind. Fast readers will have trouble, but so what. To the good reader afraid of complexity, I would offer the clear trust that must bond us to such signal poems as (simply to cite three appearing in a row) "Mother's Sewing Box," "For My Father Looking for My Uncle," and "The Chicory Comes Out Late August in Umbria."

During the dawn of the Republic, Philadelphia was the center of American finance. The first stock exchange in the nation was founded there in 1790, and around it the bustling thoroughfare known as Chestnut Street was home to the nation's most powerful financial institutions. <br><br><i>The First Wall Street</i> recounts the fascinating history of Chestnut Street and its forgotten role in the birth of American finance. According to Robert E. Wright, Philadelphia, known for its cultivation of liberty and freedom,&nbsp;blossomed into a financial epicenter during the nation's colonial period. The continent's most prodigious minds and talented financiers flocked to Philly in droves, and by the eve of the Revolution, the Quaker City was the most financially sophisticated region in North America. <i>The First Wall Street</i> reveals how the city played a leading role in the financing of the American Revolution and emerged from that titanic struggle with not just the wealth it forged in the crucible of war, but an invaluable amount of <i>human</i> capital as well. <br><br>This capital helped make Philadelphia home to the Bank of the United States, the U.S. Mint, an active securities exchange, and several banks and insurance companies&#x2014;all clustered in or around Chestnut Street. But as the decades passed, financial institutions were lured to New York, and by the late 1820s only the powerful Second Bank of the United States upheld Philadelphia's financial stature. But when Andrew Jackson vetoed its charter, he sealed the fate of Chestnut Street forever&#x2014;and of Wall Street too. <br><br>Finely nuanced and elegantly written, <i>The First Wall Street</i> will appeal to anyone interested in the history of the United States and the origins of its unrivaled economy.</p><p><b>Robert E.

He is the author of <i>Origins of Commercial Banking in America, 1750&#x2013;1800</i>; <i>Hamilton Unbound: Finance and the Creation of the American Republic</i>; and <i>Wealth of Nations Rediscovered: Integration and Expansion in American Financial Markets, 1780&#x2013;1850</i>.<br>&#x201c;In his lively, absorbing look at the early history of America&#x2019;s financial markets, Wright brings to life the financiers and their institutions with colorful prose that teases out the human drama beneath the ledgers and account books. . . . Both a history of the nation&#x2019;s first financial capital and a surprisingly understandable financial primer . . . the book will appeal to readers interested in America&#x2019;s economic history and those wanting a better handle on banking and investing.&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Students of early national and financial history will profit from this work. Wright's narrative resurrects much long-forgotten informaition, and his analysis effectively underpins his broad thesis: Without financial markets and institutions to serve them, economic growth and modernization are impossible. Wright is at his best when explaining with remarkable clarity, the complex financial conditions that accounted for Chestnut Street's dominance." (Carl Lane <i>Journal of American History</i>)<br><br>"If looking for an entertaining stroll through the rise and fall of Philadelphia as the hub of American finance from the late colonial period to the Bank War, one needs to go no further. . . . Effectively bridging academic and non-academic audiences is a difficult feat indeed, but one that we have come to expect from a scholar as prolific as Wright." (Peter L. Rousseau <i>EH.Net</i>)<br><br>"An outstanding, accessible account of Philadelphia's status as the nation's first financial center. Robert Wright has written a breezy, clear, and humorous history of the city's central role as the American capital of banking and related industries." (Kyle Farley <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History</i>)<br><br>"Wright, a distinguished historian of early American finance, has written an unusual book that will interest both history buffs and academic historians. . . . The prose is lively and the explanations clear; the short discussion of money is perhaps the best introduction to that complex subject now available, and can be read with profit by any scholar forced to confront the complexities of monetary history." (Russell R. Menard <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"Wright reminds us that prior to Wall Street's ascendance in the 1830s, Chestnut Street in Philadelphia was the nation's financial center and the birthplace of some of America's most important financial innovations. . . . Wright succeeds in his aim to engage both the scholarly and general reader and has produced an important contribution to the history of early American finance."

He begins his chronicle in the early 19th century, tracing the expansion of opera in the United States while exploring its influences at the hands of politics, war and immigration. The staging of &#34;The Bohemian Girl&#34; in 1844, writes Dizikes, marked the birth of modern opera in the U.S. He fills out his research with rich detail about the singers, conductors, composers, patrons and fans who collectively have shepherded opera into every corner of the country--from large urban centers to rural backwaters.This lively and critically acclaimed book-the first comprehensive cultural and social history of musical theater in the United States - is a handsomely illustrated account of productions, personalities audiences, and theaters throughout the country from colonial times to the present day.</p><h2>Cotswold Way: Chipping Campden to Bath - Planning, Places to Stay, Places to Eat; Includes 44 Large-scale Walking Maps (British Walking Guides)</h2><p>All-in-one hiking route guide and maps to the Cotswold Way, a 102-mile National Trail that runs from Chipping Campden to Bath, following the beautiful Cotswold escarpment for most of its course.

Now at last, thanks to the tireless efforts of the Klingon Language Institute, this powerful drama by the legendary Klingon playwright, Wil'yam Shex'pir, can be appreciated in the elegance and glory of its original tongue. <br> This invaluable volume contains the complete text of the play, along with an English translation for easy consultation and comparison. In addition, an incisive introduction explains the play's crucial importance in Klingon culture, while copious notes illustrate how the debased English version diverges from the original, often distorting and even reversing the actual meaning of the verses. <br> <i>Khamlet, the Restored Klingon Version,</i> is a work that belongs in the library of every human who hopes truly to understand what it means to be Klingon.</p><p>Prepared by the Klingon Language Institute, <i>The Klingon Hamlet</i> presents full English and Klingon versions of Shakespeare's play side by side. Only experienced Klingon speakers will be able to fully appreciate the nuances of the Klingon-language version, but for anyone who has dabbled in the language, this is an excellent opportunity to acquire large chunks of authentic text to practice on. Most of the vocabulary used can be found in either <i>The Klingon Dictionary</i> or <i>Klingon for the Galactic Traveler</i>. <p> For non-Klingon speakers, there is Shakespeare's original text, an English-language introduction, and detailed endnotes, very wittily presented. These put forward the case that Shakespeare himself was a Klingon, and underline the essentially Klingon nature of this famous play, with its themes of honor and revenge. In creating the tragic figure of Hamlet, with his very un-Klingon propensity for brooding and procrastination, Shakespeare is believed to have been commenting on a culture becoming alienated from its traditional warlike virtues, and we are told that most Klingons find it a deeply disturbing play. </p><p> All in all, this is a very clever, well-presented interpretation of one of the world's most famous plays. The Klingon translation, in all the glory of its iambic pentameter, has been lovingly constructed, and is well worth the effort of reading at least a few favorite passages aloud. <i>--Elizabeth Sourbut, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"You have not experienced Shakespeare, until you have read him in the original Klingon".

Zachry's grandparents lived in Dallas in 1963, and saved newspapers from that era. Her grandfather was connected to the Dallas oil industry. Peterson became interested in the assassination in 1978 when she participated in the Presidential Classroom for Young Americans program in Washington, D. C. The two have collected books and artifacts concerning the assassination for years. </p><p>Both are currently employed by Midland College. The Lone Star Speaks began with a presentation the authors made to the West Texas Historical Symposium in 2014. The presentation soon expanded into a four-year research project that resulted in the authors finding and interviewing more than 150 individuals. </p><p>Among the most intriguing is Robert T. Davis, who was the Assistant Attorney General in Texas in 1963. As an attorney who was sent to help interview Warren Commission witnesses, Davis immediately sensed that the official investigation was a &#x201c;whitewash.&#x201d; Davis was one of the first to suggest that the investigation should include Jack Ruby's contacts with Mafia members. </p><p>Other witnesses whom the authors located include a Lyndon Johnson staff member who was directed by the new President to serve as his eyes and ears in Dallas after the assassination. She personally reported Oswald's death immediately to President Johnson on November 24, 1963. </p><p>Still another previously unknown witness (who even today insists on anonymity) was part of at least two &#x201c;abort teams&#x201d; in Dallas on November 22, 1963. Working with a U. S. Marshall in Dallas that day, he attempted to tell the FBI that more than one assassin had been firing at the President. More than a half-century later, he is still bitter that his information was ignored by officials. </p><p>Other individuals who have helped the authors add information to the Kennedy assassination puzzle include a personal female friend of President Kennedy, and another woman who spent the late hours of November 21, 1963 with Jack Ruby. The authors also uncovered several individuals who can personally vouch for the fact that there was and is a Dixie/Texas Mafia, and that it may have been involved with the Kennedy assassination. </p><p><em>The Lone Star Speaks</em> provides new insights into the assassination of John F. Kennedy and uses actual witness testimony to raise new questions concerning what many have called &#x201c;the crime of the twentieth century.&#x201d; </p></p><p>K. W. Zachry earned a Bachelor of Science in English and Political Science from McMurry College and a Master of Arts in English from the University of Texas at El Paso. Her interest in the Kennedy assassination began when her grandparents, who lived in Dallas on 11/22/63, shared with her all of the local newspapers from the assassination. She has been reading, researching, and &#x201c;digging for bits and pieces&#x201d; from people with first-hand information about the events surrounding the president's murder ever since. By combining information and sources with Sara, she discovered that many uninterviewed Texans possessed information about the greatest mystery of the twentieth century. Sara Peterson attended the University of La Verne in California, where she earned a Bachelor&#x2019;s of Arts Degree in Political Science and in History. After being told by her Political Science Department Chair that she could not do her senior thesis on the Kennedy assassination, she went ahead anyway, focusing on those planning, carrying out, and covering up the Kennedy assassination. Among the most powerful, she decided, was Lyndon Baines Johnson, a former Texan senator and then U.S. Vice-President. Since then, she has continued her research on the assassination and why the Warren Report&#x2019;s &#x201c;evidence&#x201d; is, in her view, inaccurate, incomplete, and in some cases manufactured. She is currently employed at a college in Texas as the Coordinator of the Developmental Education Language Lab and Writing Center.&#x201c;One of the best written books covering the life, death, and the assassination of JFK.

Kennedy should get this book and study its contents thoroughly. I was amazed by the referencing, documentation, and new material found in it. ... I believe it should find its way into the MainStreamMedia (MSM) and talk show circuits as new referenced and documented information pertaining to the cold case murder of a sitting President and his accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.&#x201d; (Robert Tosh Plumlee)<br><br>&#x201c;Book content is exceptional!

Experience Psychology is about, well, experience&#x2014;our own behaviors; our relationships at home and in our communities, in school and at work; and our interactions in different learning environments. Grounded in meaningful real-world contexts, Experience Psychology&#x2019;s contemporary examples, personalized author notes, and applied exercises speak directly to students, allowing them to engage with psychology and to learn verbally, visually, and experientially&#x2014;by reading, seeing, and doing. With the Experience Psychology learning system, students do not just &#x201c;take&#x201d; psychology but actively <em>experience</em> it. <br><br> <strong>Experience a Personalized Approach</strong> How many students think they know everything about introductory psychology but struggle on the first exam? <strong>LearnSmart</strong>, McGraw-Hill&#x2019;s adaptive learning system, pinpoints students&#x2019; metacognitive abilities and limitations, identifying what they know&#x2014;and more importantly, what they don&#x2019;t know. Using Bloom&#x2019;s Taxonomy and a highly sophisticated &#x201c;smart&#x201d; algorithm, LearnSmart creates a personalized, customized study plan that&#x2019;s unique to each individual student&#x2019;s demonstrated needs. With virtually no administrative overhead, instructors using LearnSmart are reporting an increase in student performance by a letter-grade or more. Throughout Experience Psychology, students find a wealth of personal pedagogical &#x201c;asides&#x201d; directly from Laura King to guide their understanding and stimulate their interest as they read. Some of these helpful notes highlight crucial terms and concepts; others prompt students to think critically about the complexities of the issues; other notes encourage students to apply what they have learned to their prior reading or to a new situation. These mini-conversations between author and students help develop analytical skills for students to carry and apply well beyond their course. <br><br> <strong>Experience an Emphasis on Critical Thinking</strong> Experience Psychology stimulates critical reflection and analysis. <strong>Challenge Your Thinking</strong> sidebar features involve students in debates relevant to findings from contemporary psychological research. Thought-provoking questions encourage examination of the evidence on both sides of a debate or issue. Also oriented toward critical thought are the text&#x2019;s <strong>Intersection</strong> selections. Showcasing studies in different areas of psychological research that are being conducted on the same topic, the Intersections shed light on the links between, and the reciprocal influences of, this exciting work, and they raise provocative questions for student reflection and class discussion. <br><br> <strong>Experience an Emphasis on Active Engagement</strong> With the new <strong>Experience It!</strong> feature, students can use their mobile devices to practice and master key concepts wherever and whenever they choose. Through <strong>Do It!</strong>, a series of brief, reoccurring sidebar activities linked to the text reading, students get an opportunity to test their assumptions and learn through hands-on exploration and discovery. Reinforcing that the science of psychology requires active participation, Do It! selections include, for example, an exercise on conducting an informal survey to observe and classify behaviors in a public setting, as well as an activity guiding students on how to research a &#x201c;happiness gene.&#x201d; Such exercises provide students with a vibrant and involving experience that gets them thinking as psychologists do.

The fanatical anti-Catholic Lord George Gordon is treated with some sympathy in the novel, which concludes with a panoramic description of the riots. One of two works that Dickens published in his short-lived weekly serial Master Humphrey&#39;s Clock, this was Dickens&#39; first attempt at a historical novel. The woman&#39;s husband was pressed, their goods seized for some debts of his, and she, with two small children, turned into the streets a-begging. It is a circumstance not to be forgotten, that she was very young (under nineteen), and most remarkably handsome. She went to a linen-draper&#39;s shop, took some coarse linen off the counter, and slipped it under her cloak; the shopman saw her, and she laid it down: for this she was hanged. Her defence was (I have the trial in my pocket), &#34;that she had lived in credit, and wanted for nothing, till a press-gang came and stole her husband from her; but since then, she had no bed to lie on; nothing to give her children to eat; and they were almost naked; and perhaps she might have done something wrong, for she hardly knew what she did.&#34;</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

However, their paths were quite different. Temple's logical mind controlled her social behavior. She interacted with many adults and other children, experiencing varied social situations. Logic informed her decision to obey social rules and avoid unpleasant consequences. Sean's emotions controlled his social behavior. Baffled by social rules, isolated and friendless, he made up his own and applied them to others. When they inevitably broke his rules, he felt worthless and unloved. <br>Both Temple and Sean ultimately came to terms with the social world and found their places in it. Whether you are a person with autism, a caregiver in the autism community, or just someone interested in an outsider view of society, their powerful stories will enthrall and enlighten you. <br>The first edition of Unwritten Rules of Social Engagement was the Silver Award Winner of the Book of the Year Awards and the original edition sold more than 40,000 copies in hard cover!</p><p><b>Temple Grandin</b> earned her Ph.D. in animal science from the University of Illinois, and became an associate professor at Colorado State University.

In celebration, an updated and expanded ninth edition of this American classic reminds us once again of the value of good old-fashioned comfort food.

The ninth edition remains true to its roots, presenting exemplary instruction, savory mainstream dishes (that still make use of convenience foods and the products of parent company General Mills), and, most notably, standout chapters on baking and dessert specialties. New to this edition, which offers nearly 1,000 recipes, are grilling and vegetarian chapters; up-to-date nutrition information; additional color photos; and contemporary formulas for the likes of Brie with Caramelized Onions, Asiago Bread, and Tandoori Chicken with Chutney.<p> Instruction was and is the book's strongest suit, and any cook--novice to professional--will benefit from its many how-to features. These include step-by-step directions with photos, tips for kitchen timesaving, and troubleshooting advice. The book also includes several comprehensive glossaries (those on cooking terms and ingredients are particularly good). Standouts among the vast recipe collection, more than 300 of which are designated fast or low fat, include old favorites such as Macaroni and Cheese, Old-Fashioned Baked Beans, and Lemon Chiffon Cake. A few newer ones, such as Sun-Dried Tomato and Olive Bread, also qualify. Published, as ever, in a loose-leaf binder, the book celebrates American culinary know-how, a broad-based tradition of good home cooking, exemplary baking, and the conviction that food and commerce can meld to help people cook easier and eat better.

Alexei, Elena, and Nikolka Turbin have just lost their mother their father had died years before and find themselves plunged into the chaotic civil war that erupted in the Ukraine in the wake of the Russian Revolution. In the context of this family&#x2019;s personal loss and the social turmoil surrounding them, Bulgakov creates a brilliant picture of the existential crises brought about by the revolution and the loss of social, moral, and political certainties. He confronts the reader with the bewildering cruelty that ripped Russian life apart at the beginning of the last century as well as with the extraordinary ways in which the Turbins preserved their humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this volume Marian Schwartz, a leading translator, offers the first complete and accurate translation of the definitive original text of Bulgakov&#x2019;s novel. She includes the famous dream sequence, omitted in previous translations, and beautifully solves the stylistic issues raised by Bulgakov&#x2019;s ornamental prose. Readers with an interest in Russian literature, culture, or history will welcome this superb translation of Bulgakov&#x2019;s important early work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This edition also contains an informative historical essay by Evgeny Dobrenko.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><i>The White Guard</i> is less famous than Mikhail Bulgakov's comic hit, The Master and Margarita, but it is a lovely book, though completely different in tone. It is set in Kiev during the Russian revolution and tells a story about the war's effect on a middle-class family (not workers). The story was not politically correct and thereby contributed to Bulgakov's lifelong troubles with the Soviet authorities. It was, however, well-loved, and the novel was turned into a successful play at the time of its publication in 1967.<p>Marian Schwartz is a prize-winning translator of Russian who recently received her second Translation Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts to translate Olga Slavnikova&#x2019;s newest novel, <i>2017</i>.

Doctors loathed this time-consuming procedure and for centuries relied on midwives. Later, they substituted the efficiency of mechanical devices, including the electric vibrator, invented in the 1880s. In <i>The Technology of Orgasm</i>, Rachel Maines offers readers a stimulating, surprising, and often humorous account of hysteria and its treatment throughout the ages, focusing on the development, use, and fall into disrepute of the vibrator as a legitimate medical device.</p></p><p>For centuries, women diagnosed with "hysteria"--a "disease paradigm," in Rachel P. Maines's felicitous phrase, thought to result from a lack of sexual intercourse or gratification--were treated by massaging their genitals in order to induce "paroxysm." Male physicians, however, considered the practice drudgery, and sought various ways of avoiding the task, often foisting it off on midwives or, starting in the late 19th century, employing mechanical devices. Eventually, these devices became available for purchase and home use; one such "portable vibrator" is advertised in the 1918 Sears, Roebuck catalog as an "aid that every woman appreciates." <i>The Technology of Orgasm</i> is an impeccably researched history that combines a discussion of hysteria in the Western medical tradition with a detailed examination (including several illustrations) of the devices used to "treat" the "condition." (Maines is somewhat dismissive of the contemporary, phallus-shaped models, which she describes as "underpowered battery-operated toys," insisting that "it is the AC-powered vibrator with at least one working surface at a right angle to the handle that is best designed for application to the clitoral area.") Don't expect any cheap thrills, though; the titillation Maines offers is strictly intellectual. <i>--Ron Hogan</i><p><b>Rachel P.

Most parents struggle with this shift because they suffer from a negativity bias, thanks to evolutionary development, giving them &#x201c;strengths-blindness.&#x201d; By showing us how to throw the &#x201c;strengths switch,&#x201d; Lea Waters demonstrates how we can not only help our children build resilience, optimism, and achievement but we can also help inoculate them against today&#x2019;s pandemic of depression and anxiety.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>As a strengths-based scientist for more than twenty years, ten of them spent focusing on strengths-based parenting, Waters has seen how this approach enhances self-esteem and energy in both children and teenagers. Yet more on the plus side: parents find it a particularly exciting and rewarding way to raise children. With many suggestions for specific ways to interact with your kids, Waters demonstrates how to discover strengths and talents in our children, how to use positive emotions as a resource, how to build strong brains, and even how to deal with problem behaviors and talk about difficult situations and emotions. As revolutionary yet simple as <i>Mindset </i>and <i>Grit</i>, <i>The Strength Switch </i>will show parents how a small shift can yield enormous results.</p><p><b>Lea Waters, Ph.D., </b>is President of the International Positive Psychology Association and the Gerry Higgins Chair in Positive Psychology at the University of Melbourne, Australia.

She has also served as a consultant to a wide range of businesses. Waters lives in Melbourne, Australia, with her husband, Matthew Scholes; her son, Nicholas; and her daughter, Emily.Martin Seligman is widely known as a leading authority on positive psychology, a branch of psychology that scientifically studies how positive emotions, strengths, and virtues help us thrive. I had met Marty when he came to Australia to establish a positive psychology approach at a school near the University of Melbourne, where I work. I had just transferred to the Melbourne Graduate School of Education from the School of Business and Economics, where as an organizational psychologist I&#x2019;d been studying and consulting for organizations on integrating positive psychology into the workplace, particularly on how focusing on strengths as opposed to weaknesses could improve performance. Basically, I&#x2019;d swapped offices for classrooms, senior execs for teachers, and workers for school kids. I was also leading the establishment of our Centre for Positive Psychology, a dedicated facility that was a first for Australia, for the university, and for me.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marty and I were talking about how effective school systems could be for introducing positive psychology to children so kids could do better in school, feel better about themselves, and become adults who will shape a society empowered by positive psychology.<br> &nbsp;<br> But as a psychologist and parent of two children, I knew that, in the infinite ways parents connect with children every day, families are by far the most powerful positive psychology delivery system of all. <br> &nbsp;<br> The question was how to reach them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our conversation went something like this:<br> &nbsp;<br> Me: It&#x2019;s great that we&#x2019;re doing this in schools. But what happens when kids go home? I&#x2019;m using a strength-based approach with my kids, and I&#x2019;ve seen the benefits. Someone should do the research that would inform parents about this.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marty: Why don&#x2019;t you do it?<br> &nbsp;<br> Me: But I&#x2019;m an organizational psychologist, not a parenting expert.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marty: You&#x2019;re raising your children this way, you&#x2019;re a qualified psychologist, and you&#x2019;re working with kids in schools. So why not you?<br> &nbsp;<br> I think that&#x2019;s when I suddenly noticed that my wineglass needed a refill!<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite initially avoiding Marty&#x2019;s question, it followed me all the way home on the thirty-hour flight to Melbourne: <i>Why not me? Maybe</i> <i>I could do it. Maybe I should do it. If I do it, I&#x2019;ll be helping a lot of parents and</i> <i>kids. </i>By the time the plane landed, I knew that bringing strength principles into families&#x2019; lives was something I had to do.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Parents: 24/ 7 CEOs of Our Kids&#x2019; Lives</b><br> These days I run strength-based workshops for schools, workplaces, and parents around the world. I&#x2019;ve found that no matter what country, continent, or culture they&#x2019;re from, two things unite all parents: the desire to help their children flourish <i>and </i>a sense of inadequacy for this task.<br> &nbsp;<br> Parenting can feel overwhelming. We&#x2019;re the CEOs of our children&#x2019;s lives, responsible for all the different departments: cognitive, physical, social, emotional, moral, sexual, spiritual, cultural, and educational. The buck starts and stops with us.<br> &nbsp;<br> Parents today have a lot more to worry about. My parents didn&#x2019;t have to think about screen time, cyberbullying, or sexting. Expectations of parents are growing, too. We&#x2019;re raising kids in an era ruthlessly focused on grades, college admission, earning potential, and social acceptance.<br> &nbsp;<br> There also seems to be less and less consensus&#x2014;and more scrutiny&#x2014;on the &#x201c;right&#x201d; way to parent. We&#x2019;re bombarded by conflicting approaches to raising good, successful kids. It can lead to anxiety about whether we&#x2019;re doing what&#x2019;s best for our child. We may feel so pressured to help our children grow into the person society says they <i>should </i>be that we may not be allowing them to grow into the person they actually <i>are</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> I know these pressures well. It takes all my confidence to tell other parents that I would rather let Nick and Emily play than provide them extra academic tutoring to pump up their grades. Am I putting them at a disadvantage? While there are more opportunities like this than ever for our children, they come with more competition and incessant chatter about how to help our child get ahead. How do we know what is the best approach?<br> &nbsp;<br> Based on my psychological research on well-being; my work with schools, workplaces, and parents; and my own experience as a parent I think the best approach is one that supports your child&#x2019;s ability for self-development, so that over time your child has the tools to take on the mantle of CEO.<br> &nbsp;<br> This approach is rooted in positive psychology and provides a child with two vital psychological tools:<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. Optimism: the force that motivates your child to create a positive future for herself <br> &nbsp;<br> 2. Resilience: your child&#x2019;s capacity to bounce back when life throws a curve ball<br> &nbsp;<br> You may be thinking, <i>That sounds great in theory, but how do I help my child acquire and use these tools?</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <b>Why Focusing on Strengths Makes Sense Today</b><br> Our quest to define and live &#x201c;the good life&#x201d; goes back to the ancient philosophers, but only in recent decades have we started examining the question scientifically. The strength-based approach gives us the power to live the good life by drawing on our most abundant inner resources. When we use it with our children, they internalize the idea that they have strengths, and they learn to use them to take charge of their life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why, then, do we tend to focus on the negative? As many parents confide to me: &#x201c;I love my kid, but I keep criticizing him. What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I have two words for you: <i>old wiring</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our brains were shaped by the rigors of survival into becoming brilliant pattern detectors. For most of our evolution, we&#x2019;ve survived by quickly alerting to disruptions in the patterns of daily life as clues to possible danger or to weaknesses that put us at a disadvantage: That unusual movement in the grass might be a lurking predator . . . That one unsmiling face around the tribal campfire might be an enemy . . . Our inability to run as fast as the others might mean we&#x2019;ll be left behind when fleeing danger . . . and so on. This primeval tendency to zoom in on what&#x2019;s &#x201c;off&#x201d; helped us size up our chances for survival and decide whether our world might be about to turn upside-down.<br> &nbsp;<br> This negative bias can be hugely helpful when your life&#x2019;s at stake. But most of us don&#x2019;t face such extremes. For the situations we encounter today&#x2014;which usually demand complex reasoning and problem solving, sophisticated cooperation and communication, reserves of persistence, or expert facility in a specific skill&#x2014;the negative bias can put us at a disadvantage because it blinds us to opportunities, keeps us from seeing the larger picture, and bars access to the expansive thinking that unlocks innovation, collaboration, adaptability, growth, success, and fulfillment.<br> &nbsp;<br> Attention on the negative helped us survive. Attention on the positive helps us <i>thrive</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Three decades of research clearly shows the advantages of taking a strength-based approach for children and adults alike, including:<br> &nbsp;<br>*greater levels of happiness and engagement at school<br>*smoother transitions from kindergarten to elementary school and from elementary to middle school<br>*higher levels of academic achievement (as found in high school and college students)<br>* greater levels of happiness at work<br>*greater likelihood of staying at work<br>*better work performance<br>*greater likelihood of staying married and being happy in your marriage<br>*higher levels of physical fitness and of engaging in healthy behaviors (e.g., healthy eating, visiting the &nbsp; doctor)<br>*better recovery after illness<br>*increased levels of life satisfaction and self-esteem<br>*reduced risk of depression<br>*enhanced ability to cope with stress and adversity</p><h2>Science K-8: An Integrated Approach (11th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> </b>&nbsp;Packed with the science content future teachers must know, and based on the premise that integrated learning by inquiry is the cornerstone of effective science teaching, the&nbsp;eleventh edition of this classic again focuses on the four developmental components of both teaching and learning&#x2014;the <i>why, what, how, </i>and <i>how well </i>of teaching.

Others who will find it to be a useful reference are experienced teachers, administrators, and science curriculum specialists. </p> <p> Exemplary K-8 educational programs are rooted in celebrating and building upon the diverse characteristics and needs of young people. To become and to remain exemplary, teachers in such programs must be in a continual mode of inquiry, reflection, and change. It is no different for us as the authors of this book. In a continuing effort to prepare a comprehensive and exemplary book on teaching science to children of grades K-8, we are in a <i>continual mode of inquiry</i> into the latest findings in research and practice, in <i>constant reflection</i> as we listen to and assess the comments from practitioners in the field and from users and reviewers of the book, and in <i>steady change</i> as we respond to the challenge of providing new coverage for integrating methods and resources. </p> <p><b>Organization of This Edition: An Overview</b></p> <p> Competent teaching is a kaleidoscopic, multifaceted, eclectic process. When preparing and writing a book for use in one segment of a program for teacher preparation, by necessity one must separate that kaleidoscopic process into separate parts, which is probably impossible to do in a way that makes the most sense to everyone using the book. </p> <p> This book continues to be divided into two parts. For the sake of clarity and sensible organization for this tenth edition, Part One was reorganized to address what we consider to be the four developmental components of teaching and learning: </p> <ul> <li><i>why</i>&#x2014;the rationale to support the components that follow</li> <li><i>what</i>&#x2014;the content, processes, and skills you will be helping children learn</li> <li><i>how</i>&#x2014;how you will do it</li> <li><i>how well</i>&#x2014;how well you are doing it</li> </ul> <p> Together, these four components constitute the essentials of effective instruction. The visual map above illustrates how these four components are divided. </p> <p> It is neither likely nor advisable that one should or could effectively learn about one component entirely exclusive of the others. The four components are inextricably intertwined, with each affected by and dependent upon the others. Indeed, teaching and learning are reciprocal processes that depend on and affect one another. For example, for the sensible organization of this book, assessment is addressed as the fourth and final component of competent instruction even though it is really an integral part of an ongoing process in the total educational arena. For example, one cannot thoroughly plan for the instruction (Chapter 7) without considering the learning objectives (Chapter 2) and the assessment strategies (Chapter 8). </p> <p><b>Our Beliefs: How and Where They Are Reflected in This Book</b></p> <p> As a teacher, your greatest resources are the children you teach and the adults with whom you work. This is not a book of recipes; we are preparing teachers, not chefs. We cannot tell you what will always succeed best with your students; you will know them better than we do. In this book we do share the best of practice, the most useful of research findings, and the richest of experiences. </p> <p> <b><i>Integrated learning by inquiry is the cornerstone of effective science instruction for the twenty-first century.</i></b> We present strategies that integrate learning and provide illustrations of how they may be used. Active learning by student inquiry and teaching for thinking are emphasized in this book. You are probably well aware that professional education is rampant with its own special jargon, which can be confusing to the neophyte. The use of the term <i>direct teaching</i> (or its synonym, <i>direct instruction</i>), and its antonym, <i>direct experiences,</i> are examples of how confusing the jargon can be. The term <i>direct teaching</i> (or <i>direct instruction,</i> or <i>expository teaching,</i> or <i>teacher-centered instruction</i>) can also have a variety of definitions, depending on who is doing the defining. In this book, we try to keep our use of terminology simple and succinct. For example what we mean by <i>integrated approach to learning</i> is addressed in Chapter 1, and <i>inquiry</i> is addressed in Chapter 5. </p> <p> <b><i>Effective science teaching doesn't just happen. Certain understandings and behaviors are absolutely fundamental for the most effective teaching and learning to occur.</i></b> Fundamental understandings include the nature of science and how children learn science (Chapter 3). Fundamental teacher behaviors (Chapter 4) create the conditions needed to enable students to think and to learn, whether the learning is a further understanding of a science concept, the internalization of attitudes and values, the development of cognitive processes, or the actuating of the most complex behaviors (all addressed in Chapter 2). Clearly, at least some of the fundamental teacher behaviors are also instructional strategies. Questioning is one example. The difference is that the behaviors must be in place for the most effective teaching to occur, but strategies (Chapter 5) are more or less discretionary; that is, they are pedagogical techniques from which you may select but are not obligated to use. For example, questioning and the use of silence are fundamental teaching behaviors (discussed in Chapter 4), whereas lecturing (Chapter S) and taking children on a field trip (Chapter 6) are not. Therefore, you see, your task is two-fold: (1) develop your awareness of and skills in using the fundamental teaching behaviors, and (2) develop your repertoire and skills in selecting and using appropriate instructional strategies for facilitating children's learning of science. Only beginning now, your understanding and development of these skills will continue throughout your teaching career. </p> <p> <b><i>To be most effective, a teacher must use an eclectic style in teaching.</i></b> Rather than focus your attention on particular models of science instruction, we emphasize the importance of an eclectic model&#x2014;that is, one in which you select and integrate the best from various instructional approaches. For example, while much of the time you will want to use an indirect, social-interactive, student-centered approach that features process-based, cooperative learning and project-based learning, there are times when you will want to use a direct, expository, and content-centered approach. More often the exemplary teacher is doing both at the same time, that is, using what we refer to as <i>multilevel instruction</i> (see Chapter S). Our desire is to present understanding and guidelines that will assist you in developing the skills necessary for selecting and using a specific approach. Practice, experience, time, and reflection are your best allies for increasing your effectiveness in implementing multilevel instruction. </p></p><h2>D. L.

"This brown girl dancing is me," Reeny announces, as her crayoned figures flit across the classroom walls. Soon enough we are drawn into Reeny's remarkable dance of self-revelation and celebration, and into the literary turn it takes when Reeny discovers a kindred spirit in Leo Lionni--a writer of books and a teller of tales. Led by Reeny, Paley takes us on a tour through the landscape of characters created by Lionni. These characters come to dominate a whole year of discussion and debate, as the children argue the virtues and weaknesses of Lionni's creations and his themes of self-definition and an individual's place in the community. </p><p> <i>The Girl with the Brown Crayon</i> tells a simple personal story of a teacher and a child, interweaving the themes of race, identity, gender, and the essential human needs to create and to belong. With characteristic charm and wonder, Paley discovers how the unexplored territory unfolding before her and Reeny comes to mark the very essence of school, a common core of reference, something to ponder deeply and expand on extravagantly. </p></p><p><b>Vivian Gussin Paley</b>, a former kindergarten teacher, is the winner of a MacArthur Award and of the 1998 American Book Award for Lifetime Achievement given by the Before Columbus Foundation.Paley's book is the breathtaking account of a golden time she has carved out in the lives of [her school] children and herself. Essentially, she conducts a high-power kindergarten think tank in which she, the children, and some parents explore 'the artist's role in society, the conditions necessary for thinking, and the influence of music and art on the emotions.' Infected by their teacher's enthusiasm, wisdom, and human warmth, these beautiful children shape their semester of art, dance, song, and applied psychology around 14 picture books by the great writer-illustrator Leo Lionni...[Paley] render[s] tellingly the originality and sensitivity with which her kindergartners explore art and life as they skip from work to work, character to character, and back to their daily lives with persistence, eloquence, and depth...Her book is a reminder for adult readers that our task, at home and abroad, is to ensure that children may flourish with such awareness of their own worth that they can be free, then, to love another.<br> --Peter F. Neumeyer (<i>Boston Sunday Globe</i>)<br><br>I was delighted after an initial reading of <i>The Girl With the Brown Crayon</i> and couldn't wait to share it. However, after rereading the text and discussing it as a member of a learning community, I can more fully appreciate why it was awarded Harvard University Press's annual prize for an outstanding publication about education and society. (<i>Reading Teacher</i>)<br><br>[Paley describes how] she decides to give direction to her curriculum by focusing on the books of one author, Leo Lionni...The result, as recorded in the book, is a long exploration, questioning, and debate among the children and teachers about the characteristics and actions of the characters and important ideas (which become curriculum themes) as the books are read, dramatized, and portrayed in notebooks and posters. Throughout this journey, Paley shares her unique insight into the nature of young children and kindergarten learning as it could be, as it should be. (<i>Young Children</i>)<br><br>Paley, the charismatic teacher and author...is taken on a metaphorical journey of discovery and self-discovery by kindergartners with inquiring minds...[Paley's class] is an oasis, blessed with a unique curriculum and a teacher willing to be taught by her students. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>To focus a year's curriculum on a single writer, no matter how acclaimed or popular, was a departure for [Vivian Gussin Paley] and her school. But as anyone can tell from reading <i>The Girl with the Brown Crayon,</i> Paley's experiment was a resounding success, cultivating among very young children a deep engagement with literature that they were able to share every day.<br> --Molly McQuade (<i>Book Links</i>)<br><br>A beautifully realized, deceptively simple classroom memoir from a longtime kindergarten teacher and author. Paley begins the narrative of her final year of teaching by focusing on Reeny, a self-assured, thoughtful, and creative black five-year-old girl in a class that's mostly Caucasian and Asian. Reeny is a wonderful character, but it is her identification with another character, Frederick the mouse in a Leo Lionni children's book, that is the catalyst for a truly remarkable classroom experience...Disproving the general opinion that kindergartners are unable to focus on a lengthy, ongoing project, these children show an amazing aptitude for referring back to previous discussions, understanding metaphor, relating their reading to the world around them, and using the information they glean in creative and unusual ways. Their discussions cover everything from race and friendship to gender and the artistic personality, and they are able to appreciate the Lionni titles with a maturity that is sometimes startling...The reader closes the book with the hope that Paley will, with Reeny's help and her own newfound self-awareness, overcome her ambivalence about standing out and continue to write superb books like this one. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>Paley [tells how she] and her co-teacher turn a sizable portion of their curriculum over to a study of Lionni stories, and her students blossom with insight...Paley's book is a treasure for anyone who wants to know more about what magic is possible in a classroom where a teacher encourages what Paley calls...a "narrative community."<br> --Carol Doup Muller (<i>San Jose Mercury News</i>)</p><h2>The Mission of Art</h2><p><i>The Mission of Art </i> is an inspirational text for artists and anyone who has glimpsed the spiritual power of art. Alex Grey traces the evolution of human consciousness through art history, seeking the threads of art's abiding mission. He reflects on the development of his own work, including provocative performances and the profoundly affecting psychedelic experiences which lead to his unique visionary art. He explores the role of an artist's intention and conscience, and how we of the postmodern age can draw on the creative process as a spiritual path. <br><br>A thought-provoking examination of how culture makes the soul visible, <i>The Mission of Art </i> challenges us to aim high with our creativity and bring beauty and fresh vision to our depleted and cynical world. The text is accompanied by over fifty black and white reproductions of the author's own drawings and paintings.</p><p>Alex Grey is best known for his depictions of the human body that "x-ray" the multiple layers of reality and reveal the interplay of anatomical and spiritual forces. His paintings have been featured in venues as diverse as the album art of the Beastie Boys, <i>Newsweek </i>magazine, the Discovery Channel, rave flyers and sheets of blotter acid. Grey's artworks have been exhibited and performed throughout the world and are chronicled in the book <i>Sacred Mirrors: The Visionary Art of Alex Grey. </i> He lives in New York City.In this Technicolor manifesto calling for a renewed spiritual content in modern art, Grey argues that contemporary artists have lost touch with the search for transcendence that infused the work of such masters as Michelangelo, van Gogh, Pollock and Kahlo. In a freewheeling narrative, Grey compares what he sees as the materialism and moral irresponsibility of most contemporaryart to his own creative endeavors, which draw on meditation, visualization, shamanic drumming, Taoism, yoga and Tibetan Buddhism. The book is bursting with his own mystical paintings and drawings, depicting floating cosmic eyes, the soul leaving the body of a dying person, haloed skulls, metaphysical thought-diagrams, human torsos lit from within by chakras or psychic energy centers. If this sounds reminiscent of the psychedelic 1960s, that may be because, as Grey freely admits, "sacramental" hallucinogens like LSD and mescaline have been a source of inspiration for him since the mid-1970s. He's found equal inspiration, however, in the works of Blake, Kandinsky and the drawings he made of Michelangelo's sculptures and paintings during a 1994 trip to Italy. Grey acknowledges a big debt to transpersonal psychology, the study of manifold dimensions of human consciousness, a science whose leading philosopher, Wilber, contributes the hyperbolic foreword ("Alex Grey might be the most significant artist alive"). As a hodgepodge of art-historical analysis, social commentary and spiritual philosophizing, the book is so idiosyncratic, and sometimes so preachy, that many readers will find it difficult to penetrate. But Grey's insistence that art should be a revelatory and healing force in our culture should resonate with artists in virtually any discipline. <p></p><p>Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Clinical Management of Motor Speech Disorders in Children</h2><p><p><strong><em>The book presents a strong theoretical framework to view cases within.</em></strong></p><p>Speech-language clinicians who work with children have for a long time had trouble obtaining clinical reference material designed specifically for children.

He is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry total over 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions were his writings on natural history and philosophy, where he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern day environmentalism. His literary style interweaves close natural observation, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, symbolic meanings, and historical lore; while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical austerity, and "Yankee" love of practical detail. He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover life's true essential needs. Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803&#x2013;1882) was an American essayist, lecturer, and poet, who led the Transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century. He was seen as a champion of individualism and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States. Emerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of Transcendentalism in his 1836 essay, Nature. Following this ground-breaking work, he gave a speech entitled The American Scholar in 1837, which Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. considered to be America's "Intellectual Declaration of Independence".[1] Considered one of the great lecturers of the time, Emerson had an enthusiasm and respect for his audience that enraptured crowds.</p><h2>The Basil and Josephine Stories</h2><p><b><i>Fourteen of F. Scott Fitzgerald's best-loved and most beguiling stories, together in a single volume</i></b> <br> In 1928, while struggling with his novel <i>Tender Is the Night,</i> Fitzgerald began writing a series of stories about Basil Duke Lee, a fictionalized version of his younger self. Drawing on his childhood and adolescent experiences, Fitzgerald wrote nine tales that were published in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> about his life from the time he was an eleven-year-old boy living in Buffalo, New York, until he entered Princeton University in 1913. Then from 1930 to 1931, with <i>Tender Is the Night</i> still unfinished, Fitzgerald wrote five more stories (also published in the <i>Post)</i> that centered around Josephine Perry, Basil's female counterpart. Although Fitzgerald intended to combine the fourteen Basil Lee and Josephine Perry stories into a single work, he never succeeded in doing so in his lifetime. Here, <i>The Basil and Josephine Stories</i> brings together in one volume the complete set, resulting in one of Fitzgerald's most charming and evocative works.</p><p>F. Scott Fitzgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1896. He attended Princeton University, joined the United States Army during World War I, and published his first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i>, in 1920. That same year he married Zelda Sayre and for the next decade the couple lived in New York, Paris, and on the Riviera. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s novels include <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i>, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, and <i>Tender Is the Night</i>. He died at the age of forty-four while working on <i>The Last Tycoon</i>. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s fiction has secured his reputation as one of the most important American writers of the 20th century.</p><h2>Vice: An Anthology</h2><p>A collection of poems, quotations, and longer selections from various times and places dealing with popular vices, including sexual behavior, drinking and smoking, gambling, reading, shopping, snobbery, and other amusements</p><p>Richard Davenport-Hines is the author of biographies of Dudley Docker, W.

Freccero argues that to fail to see the convergence of the letter and the spirit, the pilgrim and the poet, is to fail to understand Dante&#x2019;s poetics of conversion. For Dante, body and soul go together and there is no salvation that&#x2019;s purely intellectual, no poetry that is simply literary.</p><p>The essays that form this book were originally published between 1959 and 1984. They are arranged to follow the order of the <i>Comedy</i>, and they form the perfect companion for a reader of the poem. With these essays assembled for the first time, we can now see Freccero&#x2019;s stature: he is the best contemporary critic of Dante. Freccero is that rare article, a critic of eclectic and not dogmatic persuasion. Throughout Freccero operates on the fundamental premise that there is always an intricate and crucial dialectic at work between Dante the poet and Dante the pilgrim, and that it is this dialectic that makes the work so profoundly dramatic, one of the great novels of the self.</p><p>Thanks to Freccero we readers have the <i>Comedy</i> whole again. Freccero calls upon medieval philosophy, cosmology, science, theology, and poetics to enable us to traverse Dante&#x2019;s moral landscape without losing our way in the confusions of minute exegeses. In a secular age Freccero enables us to see this poem as what it is, something wholly other than what we might believe or write. In doing so he shows us the most that language can achieve in any age, secular or not.</p></p><p>&#x201c;A volume whose arrival must rank as one of the major events of Dante scholarship in recent decades... No summary can do justice to the subtlety, richness and learning of this invigorating book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Freccero writes with both elegance and authority. After reading him we know not only more about Dante and the Middle Ages, the making of poetry and the psychology of conversion, but about ourselves. I shall often return to this wise book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This Dante is the real right thing. Freccero is a masterly exegete with an uncannily fine ability to make his general insights blossom among real particulars.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William Arrowsmith</b><br><br>&#x201c;John Freccero&#x2019;s readings of the <i>Commedia</i> achieve a power and intricacy altogether worthy of their subject.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Merrill</b>Students and teachers worldwide will applaud this collection of Freccero's articles, destined to prove of lasting importance. In an arrangement based on the structure of the Commedia , the articles enable the contemporary reader to approach the astonishing poetic coherence of Dante's poems without sacrifice of the poem's rich historicity and detail. It is an indication of the inner unity of Freccero's arguments that the articles, though they span some 25 years, present a powerful cumulative effect even though reprinted nearly unchanged.

Miriam&#39;s parents, Hutchins Hapgood and Neith Boyce, both well-known writers at the time, were old friends of Mabel&#39;s. They had sent Miriam to Taos in the hope that it would cure the depression that had plagued her for two years. Miriam responded immediately to this magical place. She spent the summer with Mabel, stayed on into fall, and then persuaded her father to buy her a small house in Taos. In this posthumously published memoir she describes that summer and the next twelve years of her life, during which she married, became a mother, and saw the unraveling of her marriage. Her beautifully told story with its fascinating glimpses of Mabel Dodge Luhan and her circle of artist and celebrity friends - among the people Miriam met in Taos were Georgia O&#39;Keeffe, John Marin, and Leopold Stokowski - is a moving account of a young woman&#39;s coming of age and shaping an identity of her own quite different from that of her remarkable parents. Her book is valuable both for the light it sheds on the famous and for its illumination of the lives of women in general.</p><p></p><h2>Reflejos</h2><p>Building on skills acquired in the first year, this communicative intermediate program further refines students&#39; linguistic proficiency within a culturally rich framework.

His genius for scene and dialogue led <i>Time</i> magazine to describe him as &#x201c;a Dickens of Detroit,&#x201d; and <i>Newsweek</i> called him &#x201c;the best American writer of crime alive, possibly the best we&#x2019;ve ever had.&#x201d; Now The Library of America inaugurates a three-volume edition of Leonard&#x2019;s greatest work, prepared in consultation with the author shortly before his death and edited by his long-time researcher Gregg Sutter.<br><br> The four novels collected in this first volume re-invented the American crime novel and cemented Leonard&#x2019;s reputation. All are set in his hometown Detroit, a hard-working &#x201c;shot and a beer&#x201d; kind of place whose lawless underside becomes a stage for an unforgettable cast of rogues, con artists, and psychopaths. <i>Fifty-Two Pickup</i> (1974), fast and sharply written, is an insidiously brutal book about an adulterous businessman who runs afoul of a crew of murderous blackmailers. <i>Swag </i>(1976) finds Leonard moving for the first time into the more comic mode that would become his signature, as he charts the small-time criminal careers of an amiable ex-con and an ambitious car salesman who share a bachelor pad and pursue their hedonistic dream of the good life through a string of armed robberies. <i>Unknown Man No. 23 </i>(1977) spins a complex web of crisscrossing rip-offs and con games, with process server Jack Ryan, a typically laid-back Leonard protagonist, caught in the middle. In <i>The Switch</i> (1978), one of Leonard&#x2019;s funniest books, Mickey Dawson, a discontented housewife held for ransom, manages to turn the tables on her kidnappers while exacting overdue revenge on her scheming husband.<br><br> This volume also contains a newly researched chronology of Elmore Leonard&#x2019;s life, drawing on materials in his personal archive, and detailed annotations, which include as a special bonus a scene from the typescript for Swag that did not appear in the published book.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

S. Hodges The skills of the scientific illustrator must range far beyond the ability to render an attractive drawing. In addition to mastering the standard repertoire of artists&#x2019; techniques, successful scientific illustrators must understand the complex nature of their subjects and accurately depict them in a way that is useful to scientists, researchers, and others in the field. They must know the conventions of the science for which they are drawing, must be able to distinguish between important details and unnecessary anomolies in their subjects, and must use the most appropriate techniques both to render the subject faithfully and to ensure optimal reproduction quality. And they must be able to wend their way through a maze of copyright, contract, and business considerations. The Guild Handbook of Scientific Illustration provides all the guidance necessary to master the many skills of the scientific illustrator. The book opens with the basics, discussing the roles and responsibilities of both the scientist or client and the illustrator, as well as fundamental procedures applicable to any kind of illustration. The hundreds of tools and materials that the illustrator may use are then examined, with specific recommendations on surfaces, media, drawing tools, mounting materials, measuring devices, and more, the best uses of each, and tips on innovative applications especially appropriate to scientific illustration. Because many scientific illustrations are important records that must last for many years, archival considerations are important, and so the durability and permanence of surfaces and media, as well as storage conditions, are also examined. The lighting of a subject can significantly affect the depiction of important features, and so this first section also discusses different types of lighting, as well as how to depict shadows, transparency, iridescence, highlights, and more. Next, the text moves to a discussion of rendering techniques. Not just a rehash of basic raw g skills, this section explores new materials as well as innovative techniques using traditional standbys, with an emphasis on their applicability to scientific illustration. Each chapter in this section includes a complete list of necessary surfaces, media, tools, and other implements, as well as step-by-step instructions for each technique. Rendering with line and ink; graphite, plastic, or colored pencil; pencil and pastel on coquille board; carbon dust; watercolor and wash; scratchboard; gouache; acrylics; airbrush; and mixed media are all examined in detail. The complexity and fragility of the subjects of scientific illustration distinguish it from other types of illustration. Care and handling of often-rare specimens is an important consideration, as is an understanding of the taxonomic characters of each species. These concerns are addressed in the section on subject matter, which examines the illustration of plants, fossils, invertebrates, fishes, amphibians and reptiles, birds, and mammals. Also covered are wildlife illustration, anthropological and archaeological artifacts, and medical subjects. Each chapter includes a list of materials needed to illustrate and handle specimens, a discussion of the various species and their important traits, and any conventions followed when rendering a particular subject. Also examined here are ways to reconstruct incomplete specimens, as well as extinct vertebrates. Scientific illustration is more than just rendering specimens, however. This practical volume also provides information on using microscopes; creating charts, diagrams, and maps; and reproducing artwork, both as slides or prints and for publication. Also included are important copyright and contractual concerns, as well as practical suggestions on establishing a freelance business. The book closes with an appendix that lists sources for most of the tools and equipment mentioned in the text, degree programs, professional organizations, and sources of business information. An exhaustive bibliography, arranged by chapter, rounds out this comprehensive volume. Sponsored by the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators and written by top illustrators, scientists, and experts, this veritable encyclopedia of scientific illustration is an indispensable text for the novice as well as an invaluable reference for the professional illustrator and scientist. With over 600 outstanding examples of scientific illustration in black-and-white and color, it will also serve as a source of inspiration, regardless of your area of interest. This gorgeous, comprehensive handbook belongs on the shelf of anyone who produces, assigns, or simply appreciates scientific illustration.Elaine R. S.

Emphasizes oblique paraline projections, in which the actual plan or elevation is used without foreshortening to produce the three-dimensional paraline. Also discusses methods of construction, shadow casting, and exploration and emphasis; and includes a variety of drawings by professional architects. No index or bibliography. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>Though used since ancient times, nothing is more contemporary than axonometric and oblique drawings. In the renderings of many of today&#39;s finest architects, designers, landscape architects, and artists, axonometrics and obliques express the totality of projects. . .convey a sense of real space. . .and are unsurpassed in their ability to involve the viewer. This expert treatment--stocked with carefully chosen illustrations and examples of today&#39;s best work--is the first reference that focuses on axonometrics and obliques, giving them full play and offering them their full due. The ultimate paraline--axonometric--reference for deisgners, architects, and renderers, Axonometric and Oblique Drawing first defines these three-dimensional drawings whose lines remain parallel and do not converge to a vanishing point. Using examples both old and new, as well as line drawings, this indispensable guide then shows artists step by step how to construct and use all types of paralines, from transmetrics to obliques. A hands-on reference, Axonometric and Oblique Drawing shows you exactly how to apply the conventions of axonometric drawing to achieve the information-rich, spatially evocative presentations that have made them such a favorite with architects. It shows you how to: Construct all types of paraline drawings, step by step; Handle circles, ellipses, and irregular objects in axonometric and oblique drawings; Apply shadows and shading; Use axonometrics and obliques to dramatize worm&#39;s eye, cutaway, bird&#39;s eye, split-segmented, simultaneous, exploded, and other views; Render axonometrics and obliques on vellum, board, mylar, film, tracing paper, and other media; Prepare axonometrics and obliques with computer applications; Analyze designs step-by-step; Ensure quality in the design process through axonometric and oblique analysis; Integrate axnometrics and obliques effectively with other drawings.

It is a study of the site&#x2019;s recent transformation &#x2015; Mecca, until recently, embodied a unique urban tapestry, layered with histories that are stitched together by an abundance of organically rooted communities and cultures. It is a place that accommodated not only sacred structures and sites but also huge fluctuations in population during Ramadan (up to 3 million visitors a year travel to Mecca for Eid and Hajj). More recently, these sites and communities have been eradicated and are being replaced with five-star-studded high rise developments, transforming it from an active metropolis to the world&#x2019;s most exclusive, yet most visited religious tourist destination, reflective of an unprecedented experimentation with architecture and its possible impact on social stratification. This photographic essay is a celebration of Mecca&#x2019;s real and projected or imaginary states. It provides singular access to this site and its associated social and religious rituals, along with its architectural urban planned and proposed development. <br><br></p><p><p><b>Ahmed Mater</b>, born in 1979, grew up in Saudi Arabia.

The human system for processing sound is a biological marvel, an intricate assembly of delicate membranes, bones, receptor cells, and neurons. Yet many people take their ears for granted, abusing them with loud restaurants, rock concerts, and Q-tips. And then, eventually, most of us start to go deaf.<br><br>Millions of Americans suffer from hearing loss. Faced with the cost and stigma of hearing aids, the natural human tendency is to do nothing and hope for the best, usually while pretending that nothing is wrong. In <i>Volume Control</i>, David Owen argues this inaction comes with a huge social cost. He demystifies the science of hearing while encouraging readers to get the treatment they need for hearing loss and protect the hearing they still have.<br><br>Hearing aids are rapidly improving and becoming more versatile. Inexpensive high-tech substitutes are increasingly available, making it possible for more of us to boost our weakening ears without bankrupting ourselves. Relatively soon, physicians may be able to reverse losses that have always been considered irreversible. Even the insistent buzz of tinnitus may soon yield to relatively simple treatments and techniques. With wit and clarity, Owen explores the incredible possibilities of technologically assisted hearing.

Scott Miller shows an uncommon, detailed understanding of the emotional machinery of these shows. He explores the use of the <i>dies irae</i> theme throughout <i>Sweeney Todd</i>; points out how the title character in <i>Pippin</i> becomes extraordinary only when he resolves to be ordinary; proposes unceasing motion as a staging concept and a theme in <i>Les Miserables</i>; suggests techniques to best let an audience grasp that time flows backward in <i>Merrily We Roll Along</i>; and ponders the nature of reality and unreality at the core of <i>Man of La Mancha</i>.

Beginning with a series of strange flashes in the distant night sky, the Martian attack initially causes little concern on Earth. Then the destruction erupts&#x2014;ten massive aliens roam England and destroy with heat rays everything in their path. Very soon humankind finds itself on the brink of extinction. H. G. Wells raises questions of mortality, man&#x2019;s place in nature, and the evil lurking in the technological future&#x2014;questions that remain urgently relevant in the twenty-first century.<br><br>Includes a Modern Library Reading Group Guide</p><p>This is the granddaddy of all alien invasion stories, first published by H.G. Wells in 1898. The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator tells readers that "No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's..." <p> Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100-feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. With horror his narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance, and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much a corralled. <i>--Craig E.

Not in the Chicago orphanage where he is sent by his mother, not in high school (too brainy), not even on the streets. Human attachments? Yes, he has them, but they are like everything else in his life, singular and irregular. People who know him say that he "drowns his feelings in his face," and that he has a Mongolian "masked look." But though Harry stands apart, he has always been a most keen observer, listener, recorder and interpreter, and none of this is lost on the Chicago billionaire, Sigmund Adletsky, who takes Harry into his "brain trust." He retains Harry to advise him. They discuss ordinary things - they gossip together. Old Adletsky has set feelings aside while he amassed his vast fortune. The old man is so apt that he divines the secrets behind Harry's mask, and brings him together with the one person Harry has loved dumbly for forty years.<br>Amy Wustrin has not exactly stood apart from the sexual revolution while waiting for Harry to come wooing. Far from remaining the static object of his fantasy, she has moved about in the real world, from one marriage to another, from rich to broke, from hot high-school girl to correct matron. Still, in Amy, Harry sees what he calls his "actual." Harry has had his opportunities with Amy, but it is not until he finds himself at the cemetery with her for the exhumation and reburial of her husband that he feels free to speak out.</p><p>Saul Bellow was awarded the 1976 Nobel Prize for Literature.

Chicagoan Harry Trellman, the story's narrator, is a semi- retired importer whose cautious demeanor and unusual physiognomy (he describes his countenance as ``Chinese-looking'') have made him a kind of outsider--from the centers of financial power and also from the satisfactions of romantic love. A ``first-class noticer,'' Harry is appropriated as an advisor by elderly Sigmund Adletsky, trillionaire hotel magnate, and, as a chance by-product of joining Adletsky's ``brain trust,'' Harry is reunited with Amy Wustrin, the woman he'd loved decades ago, and with the bittersweet memory of Amy's late husband and his old pal, faithless, freewheeling Jay (``If being sexual was like being drunk, Jay was something like a drunken driver''). Bellow expertly tangles these characters' lives together: Amy, an interior decorator, is hired to assess the value of furnishings in a luxury apartment the Adletskys covet--owned by Bodo Heisinger, whose wife Madge was convicted and imprisoned for hiring a hit man to kill Bodo, who nevertheless continued to adore her and secured her release. Though Harry thinks he's separated, by looks and lifestyle, from this melodramatic human muddle (``I see myself taking pleasure in these assorted people, their motives, their behavior''), he learns he's one of them--a perception emphatically confirmed by a cliffhanger ending recalling that of Bellow's great short novel Seize the Day. The working-out of these intricate plotlines is rather perfunctory, and a few redundancies have escaped editing, but the writing is sharp, and we're absorbed by the personalities of several vividly sketched characters, especially Harry, one of Bellow's most engaging everymen. Like Augie March, Harry Trellman chooses life; like Tommy Wilhelm (of Seize the Day), he's shaped and driven not by intellectual or social imperatives, but by the insistent proddings of ``the heart's ultimate need.'' -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Employing her trademark ferocity, these new dramatic monologues continue to mine this award-winning poet's "often brilliant" (<em>Chicago Tribune</em>) vision.</p><p>You know the age-old question: Suppose you could handpick a cast of living or dead characters and have them all to dinner. Who would you ask? In this searing collection, Ai does the difficult work of choosing for us. She invites a whole host of often less-than-presentable guests, including presidents ("I have a deep affection for my wife, / but also for sweet, big-haired girls... who never complain of tired jaws"), paparazzi ("I am there for you, / a friend, not an enemy, / stalkerazzi, or a tabloid Nazi"), and prurient priests ("Lord, I crave things"). Elsewhere, Ai gives voice to Lenny Bruce, a grief-stricken Marilyn Monroe, and the spurned lover who confesses "A man could never do / as much for Imelda / as a pair of shoes." Donning the mask of our most famous (and infamous) politicians and celebrities, as well as our most vilified antiheroes, she gives new life to the dramatic monologue. And in poems "by" rapists, murderers, looters, hit men, and stalkers, she puts words in the mouths of the thoroughly muzzled. Like Whitman, she writes from the conviction that every voice--no matter how despicable or seemingly insignificant--deserves the chance to be heard. <i>--Martha Silano</i><i>Vice</i> has been named a finalist for the 1999 National Book Award in Poetry.</p><h2>Health Science Fundamentals</h2><p><p> <i>For introduction to health professions courses </i> </p> <p> <b>Setting the standard for today&#x2019;s health science student </b> <br> <b> <i>Health Science Fundamentals: Exploring Career Pathways </i> </b>provides students with the skills they need to become competent and productive health care workers throughout their careers, with a strong emphasis on employability skills such as teamwork, effective communication, and ethics.

Most of us learn little or nothing about Islam in school; in fact, our knowledge of Muslims may be restricted to news reports on the Middle East and Louis Farrakhan. Surprise--the vast majority of Muslims aren&#39;t Arabs, the Muslim Allah is very much the &#34;one God&#34; Christians and Jews believe in, many of the scientific and medical innovations we take for granted were passed on by Muslims, and the popular myths about Muslims often have little to do with the real beliefs of Islam. The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide(R) to Understanding Islam reveals fascinating facts about Islam; they accept both the Old and New Testaments as holy books and accept Moses and Jesus as prophets. The book offers tips on Muslim culture, actual quotes from the Qur&#39;an, the Prophet Muhammad, and prominent scholars, and answers to questions regarding everyday life from the Muslim perspective.</p><p>It may surprise readers to discover that Islam is the fastest-growing religion in the world, according to <i>The Complete Idiot's Guide to Islam</i>. "However, even more eye-opening is the fact that Islam is the fastest growing religion in North America," writes author Yahiya Emerick (<i>How to Tell Others About Islam</i>). Paradoxically, Islam is also one of the most misunderstood and maligned religions in North America. Fortunately, Emerick has written a viable antidote to the widespread confusion and ignorance. Using the <i>Idiot's Guide</i>'s formula of questions and answers, sidebars, and small, easy-to-digest essays, Emerick makes Islam accessible to anyone who is inclined to learn more about this influential religion. Readers have much to glean from this comprehensive and balanced guidebook--primarily that Islam is a prayerful, peace-loving religion that has been misused in the name of terror, just as Hitler and other extremists have misused Christianity throughout history. Emerick devotes an entire section to "Looking at Women in Islam," in which readers can sort through even more misconceptions. The <i>Idiot's Guide</i> title belies the integrity of the book, which is an important contribution for our times. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><p> <b>Yahiya Emerick</b> is an American convert to Islam who has been involved in interfaith issues and education since 1990.

They spotted it in peeling paint, the faces of strangers, and the view from the kitchen window. They found beauty in places as poetic as Paris, and as seemingly pedestrian as a dilapidated shed. From a hawk proudly posed against a cloudless, cerulean sky to an everyday table setting transformed by light into a kaleidoscope of color, these are the moments that stopped artists in their tracks, to create the kind of paintings that do the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> "Whatever made you hold your breath or turn your head the first time you saw it, that is what you should paint!" --Kathleen Lanzoni</p><p></p><h2>Old Tokyo (Images of Asia)</h2><p><em>Old Tokyo</em> bridges the gap between Tokyo's cultural heritage and its present, describing in close detail how it evolved from the shogun capital of a closed society to the international capital of an expanding country.</p><p>Keiko Imai Packard is at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p><h2>Spelling And Vocabulary My Words To Read And Write 1 (Houghton Mifflin Spelling and Vocabulary)</h2><p>Houghton Mifflin Spelling and Vocabulary: Consumable Student Book Ball and Stick Grade 1 2006</p><p></p><h2>Karski: How One Man Tried to Stop the Holocaust</h2><p>"Karski is a story of incredible valor, a story of personal courage and uncommon determination to bring to Allied leaders the awful truth about the mass murder of the Jews of Europe.

Captured by the Gestapo, Karski escaped to bear witness of Nazi atrocities in the Warsaw Ghetto and elsewhere. Because written reports of the Germans' systematic attempt to destroy Polish Jewry were ignored in London and Washington, D.C., Karski went to both capitals, where he met Allied leaders. But his testimony was not taken seriously. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, for example, said he simply didn't believe Karski. Karski became an American citizen after the war and pursued an academic career (he is now professor emeritus at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service). In 1982 he was made an honorary citizen of Israel and recognized as one of the Righteous Among Nations. His engrossing biography is valuable, for it tempers the widespread contention that Gentile Poland was indifferent to the plight of the Jews.

A tale of deception of both the characters and the readers, the tale is commonly cited as a classic example of the unreliable narrator device in which the subjective viewpoints lead the reader astray as to what is actually happening. <br><br> Set in 1799, we witness an American trading vessel, the Bachelor's Delight, visiting to aid the San Dominick - a Spanish slave ship which has apparently fallen into distress. The American captain, Amasa Delano, notes a few oddities about Captain Benito Cereno and the ship's passengers, particularly the liberties taken by the slaves aboard ship, but is otherwise unperturbed. <br><br> With time however, the behaviour of the crew becomes more unusual - with Delano particularly frustrated in being unable to have a private word with the Spanish captain, whose behaviour appears increasingly nervous and tense - particularly in the company of one slave named Babo. <br><br> A tension-filled tale of suspense, the story has become acclaimed for its explorations of slavery, race, and human depravity. In the modern day, the novel has attracted praise for treating both the white and black characters in a realistic, unsentimental fashion. The profiteering character of Don Benito, and the fierceness of Babo, are both noted in the text.</p><p>Herman Melville (August 1, 1819 - September 28, 1891) was an American writer and the author of Moby Dick, Bartleby the Scrivener, and Billy Budd. Although he experienced some success with his first three novels, Melville quickly faded from literary fame. His other work did not gain popularity again until the early 20th century, when Moby Dick was hailed as a literary masterpiece and paved the way for the critical celebration of his other works.''In our own time of terror and torture, <i>Benito Cereno</i> has emerged as the most salient of Melville's works: a tale of desperate men in the grip of a vengeful fury that those whom they hate cannot begin to understand.'' --Andrew Delbanco, author, <i>Melville: His World and Work</i> <br> <br>''The noblest short story in American literature.'' --Edward J. O'Brien, American author and short-story anthologist <br> <br>''Superficially, this is a story of slavery and mutiny on the high seas, but beneath the adventure-charged plot lies Melville's examination of that subject which so fascinated him: the confrontation of extreme forces of good and evil in the universe.'' -- <i>Masterpieces of World Literature</i></p><h2>Mencken: The American Iconoclast</h2><p>A towering figure on the American cultural landscape, H.L. Mencken stands out as one of our most influential stylists and fearless iconoclasts--the twentieth century's greatest newspaper journalist, a famous wit, and a constant figure of controversy. <br> Marion Elizabeth Rodgers has written the definitive biography of Mencken, the most illuminating book ever published about this giant of American letters. Rodgers captures both the public and the private man, covering the many love affairs that made him known as "The German Valentino" and his happy marriage at the age of 50 to Sara Haardt, who, despite a fatal illness, refused to become a victim and earned his deepest love. The book discusses his friendships, especially his complicated but stimulating partnership with the famed theater critic George Jean Nathan. Rodgers vividly recreates Mencken's era: the glittering tapestry of turn-of-the-century America, the roaring twenties, depressed thirties, and the home front during World War II. But the heart of the book is Mencken. When few dared to shatter complacencies, Mencken fought for civil liberties and free speech. We see the prominent role he played in the Scopes Monkey Trial, his long crusade against Prohibition, his fierce battles against press censorship, and his constant exposure of pious frauds and empty uplift. The champion of our tongue in <em>The American Language</em>, Mencken also played a pivotal role in defining the shape of American letters through <em>The Smart Set</em> and <em>The American Mercury</em>, magazines that introduced such writers as James Joyce, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Langston Hughes. The paradoxes of Mencken's life are explored, as new gaps are filled regarding his notorious views of minorities and his conflict, as a German American, during two world wars. And throughout, Rodgers captures the irrepressible spirit and irreverent wit for which Mencken was famed.<br> Drawing on research in more than sixty archives including private collections in the United States and in Germany, previously unseen, on exclusive interviews with Mencken's friends, and on his love letters and FBI files, here is the full portrait of one of America's most colorful and influential men.</p><p><br><strong>Marion Elizabeth Rodgers</strong> has edited <em>Mencken and Sara: A Life in Letters</em> and <em>The Impossible H.L. Mencken</em>, a popular collection of his best journalism. She lives in Washington, DC.<br><br>"This book is both enlightening and marvelous to read."--<em>Blue Ridge Business Journal</em><p></p><br>"The most superb and entertaining biography (in any field) that I've read in years, one that has 'National Book Award' stamped all over it."--Joseph Goulden, <em>Washington Times</em><p></p><br>"Definitive.... The last word on perhaps the most famous newspaper man of the 20th century."--<em>Bloomsberg News</em><p></p><br>"Every new generation should rediscover H. L. Mencken, and every journalist should read this fine biography. Marion Elizabeth Rodgers has produced a balanced, measured portrait, proving herself as adept at probing the labyrinth of Mencken's private life as she is at placing his iconoclasm in the context of his times."--<em>The London Sunday Times</em><p></p><br>"Rodgers isn't the first to tell the story of powerful and controversial thinker and writer Mencken, but her affection for this notorious iconoclast and her access to untapped sources make for a uniquely fresh and absorbing biography."--<em>Booklist</em> (in naming <em>Mencken</em> one of the top ten biographies of the year)<p></p><br>"In this splendid biography...Rodgers juggles the dense narrative of Mencken's life and times with considerable dexterity, while also providing a glimpse into his very private world.... His was one of the key American literary lives of the 20th century and Rodgers has, quite simply, done him proud."--<em>The London Independent</em><p></p><br>"Marion Rodgers has written a comprehensive and humane biography.... In these troubled times, compared to Mencken, with all his faults, we journalists look like pygmies."--<em>The London Literary Review</em><p></p><br>"In these parlous times, when 'media personalities' parrot partisan talking points, a visit with Mencken is a seidel of cold pilsner on a hot day. Born in 1880, he died in 1956. Why do people still talk about him 50 years later? The most exhilarating way to find out is to read <em>Mencken: The American</em> <em>Iconoclast,</em> by Marion Elizabeth Rodgers. This biography, the best ever on the sage of Baltimore, is exhaustive but never exhausting, and offers readers more than moderate intelligence and an awfully good time."--Martin Nolan, <em>Boston Globe</em><p></p><br>"The most recognizably human Mencken to date.... The best, as well as the liveliest, up-to-date biography.... Mencken's timeliest quality remains his bedrock principles, particularly his commitment to civil liberty in times of hysteria--and regardless of popular opinion. Would that we could bargain with Hades and trade him for a Judy Miller or a David Frum. But as it is, we can content ourselves with Mencken's works, and be thankful that Marion Rodgers has reminded us of a time when at least one journalist held to an unswerving commitment to liberty, Comstocks and Creels be damned."--Daniel McCarthy, <em>The American Conservative</em><p></p><br>"Rodgers tells all with considerable verve.... She's certainly covered Mencken's extraordinarily complex life with exemplary thoroughness, sympathy and honesty, and more than a little wit."--<em>Baltimore Sun</em><p></p><br>"A superb study of the life of the cigar-chomping controversialist, civil libertarian and muckraker who remains the patron saint of journalists, at least of a certain age.... The best biography of Mencken to date."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"Skillfully written, broadly encompassing and fairly bristling with documentation, it is, overall, the best--as well as longest--of the [major Mencken biographies]."--<em>Chicago Sun-Times</em><p></p><br>"A biography that stands out in a crowded field because of her exhaustive research and her deft touch as a writer.... Rodgers manages to make her mark amid all this competition because, among those who have sought to provide a comprehensive, scholarly examination of Mencken's life, she is by far the most capable storyteller. The extent of her research is phenomenal...but she is never overwhelmed by her material. Rather, she is able to weave all these intricate details into a narrative that enables readers to see how this extraordinary life unfolded in real time.... Rodgers' life of Mencken is memorable and engaging...she now stands with the best of the great journalist's biographers." --<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em><p></p><br>"With obvious affection for her subject, access to untapped sources, and interviews with Mencken's friends and enemies, Rodgers offers an absorbing look at the 'bad boy of Baltimore'.... Rodgers conveys the high spirits and complexity of an American iconoclast and the turbulent times in which he lived."--<em>Booklist</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"By far the best Mencken biography ever written--and this reviewer has read almost a dozen.... This book is a masterpiece.... If you care about America, ideas, courage, and good writing and read only one biography this year, I would suggest this be the one."--<em>Toledo Blade</em><p></p><br>"Detailed, pungent, humorous and vivid.... Rodgers presents a wealth of information that, like Mencken's writing, is a true joy to read."--<em>Santa Fe New Mexican</em><p></p><br>"Even now, almost 50 years after his death, many of Mencken's political insights hold true...as Rodgers shows in this thorough work, Mencken was more than a newspaperman and prolific author.... This is a meticulous portrait of one of the most original and complicated men in American letters." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"H.L. Mencken--Henry to his friends--has always been a hard nut to crack. Now Marion Elizabeth Rodgers has, for once and for all, just about done it.... In clear and forceful prose he would have approved of, Rodgers gives Mencken his 1ightful place in American literature and life. Her book is...captivating."--Anthony Day, <em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br>"A comprehensive biography of this famously irascible writer from Baltimore."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"The most complete and the most living picture of H. L. Mencken that has ever been attempted, written with vividness and even poignancy. This is a definitive biography."--Charles Fecher, editor, <em>The Diary of H. L. Mencken</em>, and author of <em>Mencken: A Study of His Thought</em><p></p><br>"A fine piece of work."--<em>Seattle Times</em><p></p><br>"A detailed look at the life and works of one of America's foremost journalists and social critics, whose public identity outshines his private one."--<em>Denver Post</em><p></p><br>"Provides new insights into the inner life and character of a man who has always been an enigma.... But it is her sympathetic yet unflinching look at Mencken the lover and Mencken the (falsely) accused bigot and defender of Hitler that make her book special.... Rodgers' biography brings fresh understanding to America's greatest journalist, who approached every subject with complete fearlessness and honesty and the conviction that the writer must always put on a good show. Did he ever."--<em>Memphis Flyer</em><p></p><br>"H.L. Mencken, the legendary scourge of the booboisie, infuriated red-state Americans while enchanting urban freethinkers, boozers, and long-haired eggheads. In this full length portrait of the great hell-raiser and his era, Marion Rodgers discloses an old-fashioned mama's boy and a warm and apparently irresistable lover of women. Also--what a rarity!--a truly independent mind."--Russell Baker<p></p><br>"Marion Elizabeth Rodgers is a thorough scholar and not--like so many American biographers--an idolater; she has delicate intuition about her subject, a lively awareness of the warts, and overall good judgement."--Alistair Cooke<p></p><br>"The greatest American master of witty invective was also an eccentric, vulnerable human being. So we learn from Marion Rodgers's wonderful book. Wonderful and timely. 'Heave an egg out of a Pullman window,' he wrote, 'and you will hit a Fundamentalist almost anywhere in the United States today.' To paraphrase Wordsworth on Milton, 'Mencken! Thou shouldst be living at this hour.'"--Anthony Lewis<p></p><br>"Rodgers's Mencken is a latter-day Mark Twain, the man whose fights against censorship and for civil liberties were meant to benefit all Americans. The virtue of this book is that, for Mencken's many admirers, it provides a detailed, loving account of their hero as he goes about his life."--<em>Weekly</em> <em>Standard</em><p></p><br>Named one of the "Best Books of 2007" by the Arkansas-Democrat-Gazette<p></p><br></p><h2>Nolo&#39;s IEP Guide: Learning Disabilities</h2><p><b>How to advocate for your child's education.</b> <br><br> Many children have learning disabilities&#x2015;and it&#x2019;s up to parents and schools to work together to ensure that each child&#x2019;s unique educational needs are met.

But in fairness, this work was never intended to be all-encompassing. Browsability and scope are its forte; it includes basic topics of interest to most middle graders, such as skeletons, oceans, sports, and animals, as well as heavier topics like Hinduism, the Industrial Revolution, and the history of Europe. Even more obscure entries, such as the Habsburgs sneak in. DK's strength has always been its famous scannable and illustration-laden pages; this one is no different, containing more than 3,000 photos and illustrations, maps, graphs, lists, and charts. Each one- to two-page entry is quickly accessible, with a "Find Out More" blurb with related topics for those who want to dig deeper. Older middle schoolers will find this a great source for trivia on popular subjects or for piquing their interest into new areas of exploration. It might suffice as a beginning source for learning more about a research topic. A well-done index and gazetteer at the back elevate the reference factor.

This collection includes The Turn of the Screw, Daisy Miller, The Beast in the Jungle, An International Episode, The Aspern Papers and The Altar of the Dead. Major course adoption potential.</p><p>The story starts conventionally enough with friends sharing ghost stories 'round the fire on Christmas Eve. One of the guests tells about a governess at a country house plagued by supernatural visitors. But in the hands of Henry James, the master of nuance, this little tale of terror is an exquisite gem of sexual and psychological ambiguity. Only the young governess can see the ghosts; only she suspects that the previous governess and her lover are controlling the two orphaned children (a girl and a boy) for some evil purpose. The household staff don't know what she's talking about, the children are evasive when questioned, and the master of the house (the children's uncle) is absent. Why does the young girl claim not to see a perfectly visible woman standing on the far side of the lake? Are the children being deceptive, or is the governess being paranoid? By leaving the questions unanswered, <i>The Turn of Screw</i> generates spine-tingling anxiety in its mesmerized readers.Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary.

They would host a world&#x2019;s fair, showcasing the Americas, and bring millions of people to western New York. With nearby Niagara Falls as a drawing card and with stunning colors and electric lights, they hoped the fair would be more popular and more brilliant, literally, than Chicago&#x2019;s White City of 1893.</p><p>The Exposition opened with fanfare; its wonders, both strange and magnificent, dazzled the public. Then tragedy struck. In the early autumn of 1901, an assassin stalked the fairgrounds, waiting for President William McKinley. That was shocking enough, but there were more surprises in store. A female daredevil captivated crowds by trying to ride a barrel over Niagara Falls. Apache leader Geronimo startled visitors with a controversial performance. And a showman called the Animal King, the self-proclaimed star of the Midway, announced that one of his acts, the smallest woman in the world and the fair&#x2019;s &#x201c;mascot,&#x201d; had been kidnapped. Then he staged the attempted electrocution of an elephant.</p><p>In this extraordinary account, Margaret S. Creighton lifts the curtain on the assassination of McKinley as well as on the fair&#x2019;s lesser-known battles, involving both notorious and forgotten figures. In a story that is by turns suspenseful, heartrending, and triumphant, she reveals the myriad power struggles that not only marked the Exposition but shaped the new century.</p> 38 illustrations</p><p>Margaret S.

Geoff Shackelford&#x2019;s <b><i>The Golden Age of Golf Design</i></b>is an insightful analysis of those revered courses and the talented men that designed them. The list of architects working during the Golden Age is a &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Who&#x201d; of golf &#x2014; including Ross, MacKenzie, Tillinghast, Crump, Raynor and Wilson. Incredibly, the layouts they built back then &#x2014; often with only bare hands and horses to do the work &#x2014; annually make up the majority of today&#x2019;s Top 100 Courses in America.</p><p>One of the great mysteries of the royal and ancient game is how good golf courses leave players convinced they've just spent four hours either floating in heaven or stuck in the bedlam of a Hieronymous Bosch painting. A golf course is not a random creation; the best are truly works of art, and it's remarkable how many of the best were coaxed from the landscape between 1911 and 1937. This was, as the title of this lovely celebration proclaims, <i>The Golden Age of Golf Design</i>, a time when the giants of the craft--A.W. Tillinghast, Marion Hollins, and Alistair McKenzie, to name a few--were in full flourish. Their courses--Riviera, Seminole, and Augusta National among them--dominate any list of the best in the world. <p> Through deft use of archival photographs, sketches, written citations by the architects themselves, and a series of evocative watercolors by golf pro Mike Miller, Geoff Shackelford aims for why these courses continue to beckon, challenge, impress, and endure. His shot is right on target. He breaks down the designers into their various schools of thought, tracing their import, evolution, and influence. Next he introduces the individual architects themselves through short career summaries accompanied by details about their writings, golfing skills, design theories, characteristics, and, of course, a list of their legacies. Best of all are the wonderful old photos of great holes, many accompanied by snippets of design philosophy from the creating wizard. It adds up to a book golfers should savor--and study. Knowledge is power on the course, and understanding the hows and whys of the demonic challenges that designers subtly and not-so-subtly integrate into their layouts can mean the difference between a scratch handicap and scratching your head in bewilderment. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>In <i>Golfweek</i>'s recently unveiled ranking of the Top 100 American courses "opened before 1960," a staggering total of 84 were constructed between 1910 and 1937. There was never a more creative, daring, or fruitful period in the history of golf course architecture, and in <b><i>The Golden Age of Golf Design</i></b> the classic courses are revisited and celebrated. Using never before seen old photographs and little known anecdotes, Geoff Shackelford shows us how some of America's most famous courses looked in their early years. <p>The finest architects the world has ever known were practicing during this era and each is well-represented in this landmark book. C.B. Macdonald, Alister MacKenzie, Donald Ross, A.W. Tillinghast, George Thomas, William Flynn, and so many others are honored in these pages. Every important early American course built or redesigned during the "Golden Age" is included: Oakmont, the National Golf Links, Pine Valley, Merion, Baltusrol, Winged Foot, Riviera, Shinnecock Hills, Pinehurst, Oakland Hills, Cypress Point, Augusta National, Pebble Beach, Prairie Dunes, the Country Club and more.</p> <p>In the <b><i>Golden Age of Golf Design</i></b>, the original work of these "master" architects is remembered and their work analyzed. And even though the emphasis is on the newly uncovered photographs of these famous courses as their architects left them, biographical profiles and timeless quotes are included from the famous architects and their prominent counterparts to remind us of the true genius of these artists. On top of the remarkable old photography, original golf landscape paintings by Mike Miller introduce each chapter and serve as a colorful reminder of how stunning many of these classic layouts must have looked. <b><i>The Golden Age of Golf Design</i></b> brings to life many forgotten holes courses and great architects and is sure to become a classic in golf literature circles.</p></p><h2>Presenting to Win: The Art of Telling Your Story</h2><p><p> </p> <p>Thirty million presentations will be given today.

Italy, and especially Rome&#x2015;a fashionable, exciting, and comfortable city&#x2015;became the focus of such early tourists&#x2019; interest. In this distinctive book, historian Jeremy Black recreates the actual tourist experiences of those who traveled to Italy on a Grand Tour. Relying on the private diaries and personal letters of travelers, rather than on the self-conscious accounts of literary travelers who wrote for wider audiences, the book presents a fresh and authentic picture of how British tourists experienced Italy, its landscapes, women, food, music, Catholicism, and more.</p><p></p><p>Using material from archives across Britain and a generous selection of illustrations, the book highlights the discrepancy between the idealized view of the Grand Tour and its reality: what people were meant to do was not necessarily what they did, what the guide books described as splendid was not always so perceived. Black discusses what Italian experiences meant to British visitors, and he considers the effects of tourism on British culture during this most exciting of centuries. </p></p><p>Jeremy Black is professor of history at the University of Exeter and previously held the same position at the University of Durham.

Notable is the inclusion, for the first time, of discussion questions embedded in the text itself, rather than appended to the end of each chapter. This format is designed to encourage students to reflect on the material they have just digested while also making it easier for instructors to promote a problem-solving approach to the subject in their classes. Another key organizational improvement is the consolidation of what had been two separate chapters on the genetic and environmental influences on development. By combining this material, the new Chapter 3 makes a stronger, more tightly argued case for the view that development is a truly interactive process codependent on both genetic and environmental factors. <p>Like previous editions, the book shows how evolutionary biologists analyze all aspects of behavior. It is distinguished by its balanced treatment of both the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary causes of behavior, and stresses the utility of evolutionary theory in unifying the different behavioral disciplines. Important concepts are explained by reference to key illustrative studies; examples are drawn evenly from studies of invertebrates and vertebrates, and are supported by nearly 1,300 reference citations. The writing style is clear and engaging: beginning students have no difficulty following the material, despite the strong conceptual orientation of the text. </p><p>Throughout, the author keeps the essence of the scientific enterprise clearly in front of the student reader. The text stresses the role of theory and hypothesis-testing in doing science. The book also emphasizes the tentative nature of scientific conclusions, and it identifies controversial and unresolved issues.</p></p><p>JOHN ALCOCK is at the Arizona State University.</p><h2>Nurse as Educator: Principles of Teaching and Learning for Nursing Practice (Bastable, Nurse as Educator)</h2><p>Nurse as Educator: Principles of Teaching and Learning for Nursing Practice, Fourth Edition prepares nurse educators, clinical nurse specialists, and nurse practitioners for their ever-increasing role in patient teaching, health education, health promotion, and nursing education.

Number Theory. Groups. Commutative Rings. Modules. Algebras. Principal Idea Domains. Group Theory II. Polynomials In Several Variables. For anyone interested in learning abstract algebra.</p><p>Written as only Professor Rotman can pull off: spectacularly clear yet rigorous without condescension. This introduction to abstract algebra is designed to make the study of all required topics and the reading and writing of proofs both accessible and enjoyable for students encountering the subject for the first time.Preface to the Second Edition <p> I was reluctant to accept Prentice Hall's offer to write a second edition of this book. When I wrote the first edition several years ago, I assumed the usual assumption: All first courses in algebra have essentially the same material, and so it is not necessary to ask what is in such a book, but rather how it is in it. I think that most people accept this axiom, at least tacitly, and so their books are almost all clones of one another, differing only in the quality of the writing. Looking at the first version of my book, I now see many flaws; there were some interesting ideas in it, but the book was not significantly different from others. I could improve the text I had written, but I saw no reason to redo it if I were to make only cosmetic changes. </p><p> I then thought more carefully about what an introduction to algebra ought to be. When Birkhoff and Mac Lane wrote their pioneering A Survey of Modern Algebra about 60 years ago, they chose the topics that they believed were most important, both for students with a strong interest in algebra and those with other primary interests in which algebraic ideas and methods are used. Birkhoff and Mac Lane were superb mathematicians, and they chose the topics for their book very well. Indeed, their excellent choice of topics is what has led to the clone producing assumption I have mentioned above. But times have changed; indeed, Mac Lane himself has written a version of A Survey of Modern Algebra from a categorical point of view. I feel it is too early to mention categories explicitly in this book, for I believe one learns from the particular to the general, but categories are present implicitly in the almost routine way homomorphisms are introduced as soon as possible after introducing algebraic systems. Whereas emphasis on rings and groups is still fundamental, there are today major directions which either did not exist in 1940 or were not then recognized to be so important. These new directions involve algebraic geometry, computers, homology, and representations. One may view this new edition as the first of a two volume sequence. This book, the first volume, is designed for students beginning their study of algebra. The sequel, designed for beginning graduate students, is designed to be independent of this one. Hence, the sequel will have a substantial overlap with this book, but it will go on to discuss some of the basic results which lead to the most interesting contemporary topics. Each generation should survey algebra to make it serve the present time. </p><p> When I was writing this second edition, I was careful to keep the pace of the exposition at its original level; one should not rush at the beginning. Besides rewriting and rearranging theorems, examples, and exercises that were present in the first edition, I have added new material. For example, there is a short subsection on euclidean rings which contains a proof of Fermat's Two-Squares Theorem; and the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory is stated and used to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: the complex numbers are algebraically closed. </p><p> I have also added two new chapters, one with more group theory and one with more commutative rings, so that the book is now more suitable for a one-year course (one can also base a one-semester course on the first three chapters). The new chapter on groups proves the Sylow theorems, the Jordan Holder theorem, and the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, and it introduces free groups and presentations by generators and relations. The new chapter on rings discusses prime and maximal ideals, unique factorization in polynomial rings in several variables, noetherian rings, varieties, and Grobner bases. Finally, a new section contains hints for most of the exercises (and an instructor's solution manual contains complete solutions for all the exercises in the first four chapters). </p><p> In addition to thanking again those who helped me with the first edition, it is a pleasure to thank Daniel D.

The author shows how therapeutic techniques originally designed for individuals have been successfully adapted for&nbsp;couples and families struggling with a wide range of relationship problems and stressful life transitions. Vivid clinical examples illustrate the process of conducting thorough assessments, implementing carefully planned cognitive and behavioral interventions, and overcoming roadblocks. Read and used by clinicians worldwide, the book highlights ways to enhance treatment by drawing on current knowledge about relationship dynamics, attachment, and neurobiology. Cultural diversity issues are woven throughout.<br><br> See also Dattilio's edited volume, <i>Case Studies in Couple and Family Therapy</i>, which&nbsp;features case presentations from distinguished&nbsp; practitioners &nbsp;plus commentary from Dattilio on how to integrate systemic and cognitive perspectives.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><p> Frank M. Dattilio, PhD, ABPP, holds faculty positions with the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He is also in the private practice of clinical and forensic psychology and marital and family therapy in Allentown, Pennsylvania. With more than 280 professional publications in the areas of couple and family problems, anxiety and behavioral disorders, and forensic and clinical psychology, Dr. Dattilio has presented extensively on CBT throughout the world. His works have been translated into more than 30 languages and are used in over 80 countries. He serves on the editorial boards of a number of professional journals, including the <i>Journal of Marital and Family Therapy</i> and <i>Contemporary Family Therapy</i>. Dr. Dattilio is a recipient of numerous awards for outstanding achievement in the fields of psychology and psychotherapy, including, most recently, the MFT of the Year Award from the Pennsylvania Association for Marriage and Family Therapy and the Outstanding Contribution to Marriage and Family Therapy Award from the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy.</p>"Dattilio provides an excellent description of the development of cognitive-behavioral couple and family therapy and its underlying principles and constructs. He offers a thought-provoking and stimulating discussion of how attachment theory and schema therapy can inform and improve couple and family treatments. Of particular value are the book's clinically rich, vivid case examples. Seasoned clinicians and students alike will find Dattilio&#x2019;s descriptions of his interactions with couples and families to be pragmatic, flexible, integrative, and highly engaging. He is an excellent role model for how to be a sensitive and effective clinician with a variety of clients; I know I will rely on this book a great deal to train new therapists."--Kristina Coop Gordon, PhD, Department of Psychology, University of Tennessee<p>"Sweeping in scope, and backed by a thorough review of the literature, this book is an outstanding contribution to the cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) literature. Dattilio covers a great deal of ground clearly and brings the reader up to date on the latest developments in the field. The book's integration of key techniques from systemic and family therapy into a CBT model makes it a core text for every therapist&#x2019;s library."--Antony Kidman, PhD, Director, Health Psychology Unit, University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), Australia</p>"This book is a 'must read' for therapists and researchers in the family field. As a comprehensive guide to cognitive-behavioral therapy with families, it will make a great textbook to be enjoyed by many generations of students. The book is a wonderful integration of research findings and case studies; the latter are especially delightful to read, and will serve as a model for students as well as for experienced therapists."--Cloe Madanes, LIC, HDL, President, The Madanes Institute, La Jolla, California&nbsp;"Dattilio has retained the core principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) while offering an expanded perspective on schemas. He also integrates information on neurobiology, attachment, general systems theory, mindfulness, and emotion regulation. In addition to providing a conceptual framework for therapy, the book offers specific skills and techniques such as the 'downward arrow technique' and 'behavioral rehearsal.' This is the most comprehensive guide to CBT for couples and families that I&#x2019;ve seen. I especially appreciate Dattilio's thoughtful examination of the role of emotions in couple interactions.

Murray&#39;s A WRITER TEACHES WRITING has had a profound influence on composition theory and practice.</p><p>Donald M. Murray was a Professor of English at the University of New Hampshire where he inaugurated a journalism program, helped establish a graduate program in Composition Studies, and served as director of Freshman English and English Department chairperson. He twice won awards for his teaching and was awarded honorary doctoral degrees by the University of New Hampshire in 1990, Fitchburg State College in 1992, and New Hampshire College in 1997. As a journalist, Murray won a number of awards including the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in the _Boston Herald_ in 1954. He was an editor of _Time_ and has served as writing coach for several newspapers, including the _Boston Globe_ and the _Providence Journal_. In 1991 Boston magazine and in 1996 _Improper Bostonian_ magazine selected him best columnist in Boston. In 1997 the University of New Hampshire opened the Donald M. Murray Journalism Library. He received recognition for Lifetime Achievement during the New Hampshire Literary Awards in 2001. In 2003 _Writing on the Edge_ established the Donald M. Murray Prize. This award is given to the author of the best work of creative nonfiction on the subject of writing published the previous year."All of Don's books, and especially A WRITER TEACHES WRITING, are inspiring encounters with the man who has influenced generations of writing teachers."<br><br>"I have taught and mentored hundreds of teachers in a multitude of contexts since I first picked up A WRITER TEACHES WRITING. And they, in turn, have been introduced in some way, to some thing, that Don Murray has crafted for the field. No matter where we have been or where we go from here--pre-process to post-process and beyond--Don Murray's voice will echo throughout our pedagogical and theoretical conversations."<br><br>"Don Murray's A WRITER TEACHES WRITING is to the writing process movement what Walden is to the American Renaissance - part manifesto, part how-to manual, part field guide. Even decades after its first publication, it still remains as wise, comprehensive, and daring as any book I've ever read on writing instruction."<br><br>"Donald Murray's great contribution to Composition Studies lies in the powerful simplicity of the idea that is at the center of his work: to teach writing effectively we should understand how writers write. The title of this important book is especially apt, for Murray has always seen himself as a writer as well as a teacher. He helped many of us see ourselves as writers as well, and he taught us to see our students as writers, too."</p><h2>Technical Analysis For Dummies</h2><p>A simple, straightforward guide to the fundamentals of technical analysis <p>Technical analysis is a collection of techniques designed to help people make trading decisions. <i>Technical Analysis For Dummies,</i> 2nd Edition explains the basic principles and shows you how to apply these principles in an approachable and non-intimidating way.</p> <p>Since the publication of the first edition of <i>Technical Analysis For Dummies</i>, readers have been faced with many changes to the investment landscape, such as new interest rates, looming bank crises, and adjusting market climates.

He is a model for bipartisanship and political integrity. In his forty years in politics McCain has never been afraid to buck trends or ruffle a few feathers.

The first part of <i>Knowing and Being</i> deals with this theme. Part two develops Polanyi's idea that centralization is incompatible with the life of science as well as his views on the role of tradition and authority in science. The essays on tacit knowing in Part Three proceed directly from his preoccupation with the nature of scientific discovery and reveal a pervasive substructure of all intelligent behavior. Polanyi believes that all knowing involves movement from internal clues to external evidence. Therefore, to explain the process of knowing, we must develop a theory of the nature of living things in general, including an account of that aspect of living things we call "mind." Part Four elaborates upon this theme.<br> <br></p></p><p><p>Michael Polanyi (1891-1976) worked in Germany until Hitler expelled Jews from public positions in 1933, when he went to the University of Manchester as professor of physical chemistry.

The art history classroom is a unique learning environment that most students first experience in college. <i>Survival Guide</i> is sympathetic to this, offering practical instruction and guidance for every moment in students' coursework, from the initial disorientation of their first art history class ("art in the dark") to the challenge of the slide exam. </p> <p> <i>Survival Guide</i> gives practical guidance on how to take notes, write paper assignments, as well as how to study for and take exams. It deals with the kinds of questions that students commonly ask but professors seem hesitant to write about: "Isrit art history a gut course?", "What in the world do you do with a degree in art history?", "Is 500 BC later or earlier than 190 AD?", and "How can I take notes and look up at slides at the same time?" Designed for student readers, <i>Survival Guide</i> is written in a familiar and engaging tone. </p> <p> The images discussed and illustrated are primarily those of western art from the ancient to modern eras. By focusing on images that are taught in standard art history survey courses, <i>Survival Guide</i> reinforces and builds upon course materials. </p><p><b>TO THE STUDENT</b></p> <p> This book is written for you, the college student, who has had little or no experience with courses in art history. While you are familiar with how English classes are run, and feel comfortable with the format of science labs, what you will experience in an art history class is entirely new. As the class begins, the lights go down, and slides are projected on screens in pairs. Certainly, you have been to slide lectures before, but in those cases only one slide was projected at a time. And not only is the visual format new, but now your professor is actually <i>talking about the slides.</i> You had always thought that art was meant to be admired in silence. How are you, a student, supposed to put your own words to great works of art? In the upcoming weeks, you will be asked to do just that&#x2014;to speak about images, to write about them, to remember them, to prioritize information about them&#x2014;in sum, to engage with them visually in a way that has never been asked from you before. This book is designed to guide you through the process, assisting you with art history papers, exams, and note-taking. It will also help you with two frequently asked questions: "Why take an art history course?" and "What in the world do I do with a major in art history?" Finally, knowing that you are already saddled with tedious reading assignments, I have written the book in a style that is conversational and humorous. </p> <p><b>TO THE TEACHER</b></p> <p> As teachers, we often forget the profound disorientation that first-time art history students can experience. Yet as I have learned from numerous conversations with my, students, the transition from other courses to art history is not a natural one. It often takes weeks for students to become acclimatized; some, particularly in large lecture classes, never do. "This is my first art history class," I am told after lecture. "I don't know what I am doing." Those who <i>have</i> previously taken a course or two are regarded with awe, as though they are members of some secret society. </p> <p> This book will accompany the student through the adjustment process. It is intended to be read either straight through, in tandem with, or prior to your lectures, or as a reference text. Its organization reflects what I believe are the standard components of the introductory art history class as taught in colleges and universities in the United States. Hence it focuses on the traditional canon. I admit that African, pre-Columbian, and Native American art are not covered here, nor are newer forms of art, such as video and film. </p> <p> Each chapter will address a different aspect of the course. Chapter One emphasizes the value of art history as a discipline. Chapter Two is devoted to note-taking and listening in lectures. Chapter Three covers the process of writing response essays. In Chapter Four we deal with taking art history exams, and Chapter Five explores research projects. Although many existing guidebooks define basic terms and concepts used in the discipline, this book also explains how to take art history: how to listen to a lecture, how to discuss images, and how to study. Chapters will include strong (and weak) examples of exam answers and paper extracts. They will also address some of the usual worries of art history students: "How can I possibly write a five-page paper describing one work of art?" The concluding chapter focuses on career options in the field. </p></p><h2>Upper Elementary Challenge Math</h2><p>Teachers and parents who have used Challenge Math and Primary Grade Challenge Math have asked for a book for students whose skill levels fall in between these two popular resources for high ability learners. Upper Elementary Challenge Math is designed for those students in grades 3-5 who need more challenging material than they typically encounter in most math curriculums. As in other Zaccaro math books, problems are presented at 4 levels of difficulty after each chapter&#39;s instruction. In addition, each chapter includes multiple problem sets in which a single problem type is presented in increasingly complex steps, illustrating how a simpler problem can progress from one step to multi-step problem solving.

Sorel&#x2019;s quest to find himself, and the doomed love he encounters along the way, are delineated with an unprecedented psychological depth and realism. At the same time, Stendhal weaves together the social life and fraught political intrigues of post&#x2013;Napoleonic France, bringing that world to unforgettable, full-color life. His portrait of Julien and early-nineteenth-century France remains an unsurpassed creation, one that brilliantly anticipates modern literature. <br><br>Neglected during its time, <b>The Red and the Black</b> has assumed its rightful place as one of the world&#x2019;s great books, and Burton Raffel&#x2019;s extraordinary new translation, coupled with an enlightening Introduction by Diane Johnson, helps it shine more brightly than ever before.</p><p>Praise for <b>Burton Raffel&#x2019;s translations</b><br><br>For <b>Balzac&#x2019;s <i>P�re Goriot</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Raffel&#x2019;s <i>P�re Goriot</i> is both faithful and beautiful, and that makes it a masterpiece.&#x201d; &#x2014;Alain Renoir<br><br>&#x201c;I predict that this translation will give Balzac&#x2019;s great novel a new life for English and American readers. . . .

But most of us know very little about how the disease works, why we treat it the way we do, and the personalities whose dedication got us where we are today. For fifty years, Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr. has been one of those key players: he has held just about every major position in the field, and he developed the first successful chemotherapy treatment for Hodgkin&#x2019;s lymphoma, a breakthrough the American Society of Clinical Oncologists has called the top research advance in half a century of chemotherapy. As one of oncology&#x2019;s leading figures, DeVita knows what cancer looks like from the lab bench and the bedside. <i>The Death of Cancer </i>is his illuminating and deeply personal look at the science and the history of one of the world&#x2019;s most formidable diseases. In DeVita&#x2019;s hands, even the most complex medical concepts are comprehensible.</p><p>Cowritten with DeVita&#x2019;s daughter, the science writer Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn, <i>The Death of Cancer</i> is also a personal tale about the false starts and major breakthroughs, the strong-willed oncologists who clashed with conservative administrators (and one another), and the courageous patients whose willingness to test cutting-edge research helped those oncologists find potential treatments. An emotionally compelling and informative read, <i>The</i> <i>Death of Cancer </i>is also a call to arms. DeVita believes that we&#x2019;re well on our way to curing cancer but that there are things we need to change in order to get there. Mortality rates are declining, but America&#x2019;s cancer patients are still being shortchanged&#x2015;by timid doctors, by misguided national agendas, by compromised bureaucracies, and by a lack of access to information about the strengths and weaknesses of the nation&#x2019;s cancer centers.</p><p>With historical depth and authenticity, DeVita reveals the true story of the fight against cancer. <i>The Death of Cancer </i>is an ambitious, vital book about a life-and-death subject that touches us all.</p></p><p><p>Vincent T. DeVita Jr., M.D. is a professor of medicine, epidemiology, and public health at the Yale School of Medicine.

In 1993 he became the director of the Yale Cancer Center. At the NCI, he developed a cure for Hodgkin&#x2019;s lymphoma with combination chemotherapy, proving that advanced cancers can be cured by drugs.

Visit us online at www.1stWorldLibrary.ORG - - It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted imply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.</p><p>"Outside, even through the shut window pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no color in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere."<p> The year is 1984; the scene is London, largest population center of Airstrip One.</p><p> Airstrip One is part of the vast political entity Oceania, which is eternally at war with one of two other vast entities, Eurasia and Eastasia. At any moment, depending upon current alignments, all existing records show either that Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia and allied with Eastasia, or that it has always been at war with Eastasia and allied with Eurasia. Winston Smith knows this, because his work at the Ministry of Truth involves the constant "correction" of such records. "'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.'"</p><p> In a grim city and a terrifying country, where Big Brother is always Watching You and the Thought Police can practically read your mind, Winston is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. He knows the Party's official image of the world is a fluid fiction. He knows the Party controls the people by feeding them lies and narrowing their imaginations through a process of bewilderment and brutalization that alienates each individual from his fellows and deprives him of every liberating human pursuit from reasoned inquiry to sexual passion. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be.</p><p> <i>Newspeak</i>, <i>doublethink</i>, <i>thoughtcrime</i>--in <i>1984</i>, George Orwell created a whole vocabulary of words concerning totalitarian control that have since passed into our common vocabulary. More importantly, he has portrayed a chillingly credible dystopia. In our deeply anxious world, the seeds of unthinking conformity are everywhere in evidence; and Big Brother is always looking for his chance. <i>--Daniel Hintzsche</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Public Finance and Public Policy Fourth Edition</h2><p><p>Jonathan Gruber&#x2019;s groundbreaking <i>Public Finance and Public Policy</i> was the first textbook to truly reflect the way public policy is created, implement, and researched.

We've straightened and dredged them, revetted and rerouted them, made massive efforts to control them, yet our actions have been less than successful. Too often, physical changes made to a river conflict with natural processes, resulting in--rather than alleviating--damage. Applying available knowledge on how rivers form and act could prevent such problems. In this book, Luna Leopold seeks to organize such knowledge. Widely regarded as the most creative scholar in the field of river morphology, Leopold presents a coherent description of the river, its shape, size, organization, and action, along with a consistent theory that explains much of the observed character of channels. </p><p> The laws of physics that govern rivers allow for variations, many of them dictated by random chance. Thus, a river's adaptation, as Leopold describes it, tends toward the most probable form, the one with the least variance among hydraulic parameters. We see how this probabilistic tendency plays out as Leopold views the river as a whole from headwater to mouth, in the drainage net, in the behavior of meanders, and in aspects of sediment transport. </p><p> Grounded in hydraulics, geomorphology, and surveying, as well as in extensive fieldwork on rivers in the eastern and Rocky Mountain states, Leopold's view of a river is at once technical and personal, providing both a firm foundation for understanding the behavior of rivers--including instructions for getting started in backyard hydrology--and a wealth of firsthand observations by a thoughtful and experienced scientist. It will be of immediate interest and great use as we seek to develop, preserve, and appreciate our most fluid natural resource. </p></p><p><b>Luna B. Leopold</b> is Emeritus Professor of Geology at the University of California, Berkeley. Former Chief Hydrologist for the U.S. Geological Survey and winner of the National Medal of Science, he is one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on river hydraulics and geomorphology.The strength of this book is the force of intellect and experience Leopold brings to his subject. His writing style is clear, his explanations lucid, the coverage comprehensive. This is an extremely personal, almost autobiographical book--it is certainly not a dry, equation-filled treatise. It ranks with the best of John McPhee, but in this hook the scientist speaks in his own voice. I recommend it highly. (Edwin E. Herricks, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)</p><h2>The Shi&#39;is of Iraq</h2><p><p>The Shi'is of Iraq provides a comprehensive history of Iraq's majority group and its turbulent relations with the ruling Sunni minority. Yitzhak Nakash challenges the widely held belief that Shi'i society and politics in Iraq are a reflection of Iranian Shi'ism, pointing to the strong Arab attributes of Iraqi Shi'ism. He contends that behind the power struggle in Iraq between Arab Sunnis and Shi'is there exist two sectarian groups that are quite similar. The tension fueling the sectarian problem between Sunnis and Shi'is is political rather than ethnic or cultural, and it reflects the competition of the two groups over the right to rule and to define the meaning of nationalism in Iraq. A new introduction brings this book into the new century and illuminates the role that Shi`is could play in postwar Iraq.</p></p><p><p>"The most authoritative account we have on the Shi'a of Iraq. . . .

To be fair, the government&#x2019;s nutrition advice is aimed at the average American who desires to be in only average shape (read: not obese).

See how the pyramid works below and then use it to build a better body.<br> &nbsp;<br> HIT YOUR NUMBERS<br> As a physique-conscious eater, you need to think in terms of macronutrients as well as calories. Every food you eat gets counted toward a total target amount (in grams) of protein, carbs, and fat, which you can determine by multiplying the numbers in the Men&#x2019;s Fitness Food Pyramid by your body weight in pounds. Hit these numbers and you&#x2019;ll hit your goals.<br> &nbsp;<br> With that said, your nutrition doesn&#x2019;t need to be as precise as target coordinates for a missile attack. You&#x2019;ll do just fine eyeballing portions of protein, carbs, and fat (which we&#x2019;ll show you how to do) and keeping a general tally.<br> &nbsp;<br> MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY<br> The calorie and macronutrient recommendations here are just a starting point. Every trainee needs to find the proper amounts for his own body. If you&#x2019;re not losing weight, reduce your carbs gradually, and try experimenting with bumping up your protein and fat intake a bit. If you feel as if you can&#x2019;t gain weight, you can add more carbs and even more fat, which will increase your calories sharply. For any formulation you make, give it at least a week to take effect before you make any changes.<br> &nbsp;<br> PROTEIN<br> With protein being the main component of muscle tissue, your intake of it must remain high no matter your goal. To make size gains, you need at least one gram of protein per pound of your body weight to support optimal growth. When dieting, you must create a caloric deficit&#x2014;but that can cause muscle loss if you end up cutting protein to do it. That&#x2019;s why we increase protein intake and decrease starchy carbs. To get lean, you may increase your protein to as many as 1.5 grams per pound of body weight; but start lower and increase gradually as you reduce your calories slowly. If you feel like you&#x2019;re not recovering from training or you&#x2019;re losing muscle, up the protein fast.<br> &nbsp;<br> The best protein sources are eggs, chicken, fish, lean beef, turkey, quinoa (for vegetarians), and protein powder. A three-ounce portion of lean meat or fish is about the size and thickness of the palm of your hand and contains 20&#x2013;25 grams of protein, five grams of fat or fewer, and zero carbs.<br> &nbsp;<br> CARBS<br> All carbohydrates break down into glucose, raising your blood sugar levels faster than any other nutrient. As a result, the pancreas releases insulin to remove surplus sugar from the bloodstream and maintain normal levels. Research, including a study at the University of Washington School of Medicine, has found that exercise&#x2014;particularly strength training&#x2014;increases insulin sensitivity in the muscles. So if you&#x2019;ve just worked out, more of the carbs you eat afterward will be carried by insulin directly to your muscles for replenishment. (Incidentally, this goes for protein too, which is why it&#x2019;s helpful to consume a mixture of protein and carbs after training&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll discuss this more later.) On the other hand, if you&#x2019;ve been sitting on the couch watching football, those carbs will just get stored around your waist.<br> &nbsp;<br> For this reason, we recommend that most of your carbs come before, during, and shortly after training. It also means that you need to eat fewer carbs when you want to get lean&#x2014;you need to keep insulin levels low. &#x201c;If someone is in fat-loss mode,&#x201d; says John Meadows, C.S.S.N., a nutrition coach and national-level bodybuilder, &#x201c;I like to limit carbs to pre-, intra-, and post-workout meals, when they&#x2019;ll go where you want them&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, to muscle tissue. For muscle gain, Meadows prefers to add carbs (shakes included) to meals around training time first, before adding them to other meals.<br> &nbsp;<br> Carb foods include potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, oats, fruits, and vegetables. Fruits should be consumed in their whole-food form and limited to two or three pieces daily (excess fructose, the sugar in fruit, is stored as fat). Green vegetables can be eaten steadily regardless of the goal. Eat one gram of carbohydrate per pound of your body weight when dieting and two grams per pound when you want to put on muscle.<br> &nbsp;<br> A fist-size portion of cooked rice or potatoes is about one cup and gives you 40&#x2013;45 grams of carbs and negligible protein and fat.<br> &nbsp;<br> FAT<br> &#x201c;We need to provide a baseline level of good fats for hormone production,&#x201d; says Nate Miyaki, C.S.S.N., a nutrition consultant and bodybuilder in San Francisco, CA. Fat, particularly the much-maligned saturated kind, helps in the creation of testosterone, which does everything from getting you big and lean to keeping your &#x201c;little friend&#x201d; ready to say hello. Contrary to popular opinion, when dieting, you don&#x2019;t need to drop your fat intake much, if at all; fat loss comes fastest when carbohydrate intake is reduced. Plus, fat is satiating as well as a good source of energy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most of your fats should come by way of your protein foods, but avocados, nuts, seeds, and a small amount of oil like coconut and olive oil can be included as well. Aim for 0.4 grams per pound of your body weight daily to start. One tablespoon of any oil is about 15 grams of fat, and one cup of almonds or peanuts has 70 grams of fat. Two tablespoons of nut butter is about the length of your thumb and contains 15&#x2013;20 grams of fat.<br> &nbsp;<br> WORKOUT NUTRITION<br> Research hasn&#x2019;t yet clarified the optimal amount of protein or carbs you should eat around workouts for the maximum benefit. But it is clear that some is better than none, and the presence of both is crucial. A 2006 study in the European Journal of Applied Physiology gave male subjects one of the following to consume after weight training: a 6 percent carbohydrate solution, six grams of amino acids (components of protein), a combination of both, or a placebo. Those drinking the carb-and-aminos shake experienced greater muscle gains than any of the other groups, which the researchers presumed was because the concoction did the most to reduce muscle protein breakdown after training.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meadows recommends taking in 25&#x2013;50 grams of protein, 25&#x2013;35 grams of carbs, and 10 grams of fat before training. Afterward, consume another 20&#x2013;40 grams of protein and 40&#x2013;80 grams of carbs&#x2014;you can begin chugging this shake during the workout as well to limit muscle breakdown even further, though this may not be necessary and could upset your stomach. We like to make shakes with whey isolate or hydrolysate as the protein source, and Vitargo or highly branched cyclic dextrin for carbs.<br> &nbsp;<br> If powders and shakes aren&#x2019;t in your budget, Miyaki says you can go old-school and eat fruit pre- and post-workout. One or two pieces should provide enough carbs to halt muscle breakdown. And a lean three-ounce slice of protein to accompany it is fine.<br> &nbsp;<br> A PERFECT DAY<br> How to plan your eating to achieve your goals<br> &nbsp;<br> Let&#x2019;s say you&#x2019;re a 180 POUND MAN who wants to lose his gut.<br> &nbsp;<br> You could start your diet eating about 2,100 CALORIES DAILY (180 � 12) consisting of 180g PROTEIN, 180g CARBS, and 70g FAT.<br> &nbsp;<br> HERE&#x2019;S A LOW-STRESS EATING PLAN TO FIT THIS GUY&#x2019;S BUSY SCHEDULE.<br> &nbsp;<br> BREAKFAST<br> 8 oz black coffee<br> 3 scrambled eggs<br> 1/3 cup unsweetened oatmeal with cinnamon<br> &nbsp;<br> POST-WORKOUT<br> 25g whey protein<br> 1 banana<br> &nbsp;<br> LUNCH<br> 3 oz grilled salmon<br> Large raw salad w/ 2 tbsp olive oil and vinegar<br> 1 cup sweet potato or white potato (cooked)<br> &nbsp;<br> DINNER<br> 6 oz baked chicken breast<br> 1 cup jasmine rice or potato (cooked)<br> Steamed broccoli&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> SNACK<br> Meal-replacement shake with 50g protein, 25g carbs, 5g fat<br> &nbsp;<br> DESSERT<br> 2 tbsp almond butter mixed with one scoop chocolate casein protein<br> and water (to make a pudding)<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Brukner &amp; Khan's Clinical Sports Medicine, Revised: Injuries</h2><p><b>THE #1 TEXT IN CLINICAL SPORTS MEDICINE....ESSENTIAL FOR PT STUDENTS, ATHLETIC TRAINERS, AND MEDICINE PHYSICIANS</b><b><br></b><b><i>The cornerstone text on sports and exercise medicine</i></b><br><i><b>A Doody's Core Title for 2017!</b></i><br><i>Brukner &amp; Khan's Clinical Sports Medicine</i> is the world-leading title in sports and exercise medicine, providing an authoritative foundation for clinicians and students.

The soldier's name was Tiberius Claudius Maximus and he served under the emperor Trajan, in his great wars in Central Europe and the Middle East. Maximus was decorated three times for bravery and became famous for hunting down Rome's great enemy, Decebalus (leader of the Dacians, whose lands covered all of what is now Romania).<br> These two volumes trace the soldier's career from the day he entered the Seventh Legion on the Danube frontier in Central Europe, in about 85 AD, to the day he retired as a cavalry officer in Mesopotamia some thirty years later. They provide a unique portrait of the life of an ordinary man who lived during one of the most extraordinary periods of Western history. In addition to the text, a huge amount of information is conveyed in the richly detailed illustrations that have become the trademark of Peter Connolly's work.<br> <br> PETER CONNOLLY has written and illustrated many books for children about the Ancient World, including the award-winning <em>Legend of Odysseus</em>. He is an honorary research fellow of the Institute of Archaeology in London.<br> <br> Also in the series:<br> <em>The Fighting Ship</em> by Bernard Brett<br> <em>The Legend of Odysseus</em> by Peter Connolly<br> <em>The Footsoldier</em> by Martin Windrow and Richard Hook<br> <em>The Horse Soldier</em> by Martin Windrow and Richard Hook</p><p><br><strong>Peter Connolly</strong> has written and illustrated many books for children about the Ancient World, including the award-winning <em>Legend of Odysseus</em>. He is an honorary research fellow of the Institute of Archaeology in London.<br>Grade 5-10-- Connolly's approach to history is unique, tracing the career of Roman soldier Tiberius Claudius Maximus. Using archaeological material including tombstones and original Roman documents, Connolly examines the progression of Maximus from the time he entered the Seventh Legion on the Danube frontier in central Europe in 85 a.d. , to the day that Maximus retired as a cavalry officer in Mesopotamia. Readers discover details of warfare and army life of the period, including weapons, tactics, training, and the mundane daily routines. Richly illustrated, with maps and index, The Legionary and The Cavalryman complement the existing literature on Roman history. Background reading, although not essential, would benefit readers. --L.

It&#x2019;s a working cattle ranch, some 290,000 acres of West Texas prairie carefully used. Here, men still earn their livelihoods on horseback, not out of blind adherence to tradition, but out of necessity. Since Samuel &#x201c;Burk&#x201d; Burnett began buying rangeland in King County in the 1890s, his cowhands have relied on methods developed by early vaqueros and refined on the great trail drives. In managing cattle, these methods are still the most efficient and humane. Spurs, broad-brimmed hats, and scuffed and patched boots are not fashion statements but essentials&#x2014;as are loyalty, toughness, and resourcefulness, traits still common to those doing dangerous work in remote country.Perhaps, though, the Four Sixes&#x2019; greatest legacy is the land itself. Across four generations, foremen have striven to nurture and restore, to leave a healthy range. That stewardship has produced some of the richest, most ecologically diverse grassland found on the Southern Plains today.Meinzer and Chappell&#x2019;s defining study of the Sixes&#x2019; heart, soul, and heritage illuminates and spellbinds, teasing out a continuum that reaches out to and claims us all with rich lessons in give and take, need and nurture, enterprise and farsightedness.</p><p>Henry Chappell has written two novels, The Callings and Blood Kin, and an essay collection, At Home on the Range with a Texas Hunter.

Banking on Baghdad tells the dramatic and tragic history of a land long the center of world commerce-and documents the many ways Iraq's recent history mirrors its tumultuous past. Tracing the involvement<br> of Western governments and militaries, as well as oil, banking, and other corporate interests in Iraq, Black shows that today, just as yesterday, the world needs Iraq's resources-and is always willing to fight and invade in order to acquire and protect them.<br> While demonstrating that Iraq itself is partially to blame for its current state of turmoil, Black does not shy away from the uncomfortable truth that war and profit have also played an equal part in creating the Iraq we know today. Just as he did in IBM and the Holocaust, Black exposes the hidden associations between leading corporations, war, and oil-such as the astonishing connections between Nazi Germany, Iraq, and the Holocaust.<br> He exposes the war and race-based profiteering by some of the world's most prestigious corporations, as well as the political and economic ties between the Bush administration and the companies that gain handsomely from its foreign policy. Just as he did in War Against the Weak, Black offers a compelling blend of history and contemporary investigative journalism that spans a century and eschews easy answers for complicated questions.<br> Edwin Black (Washington, DC) is the award-winning New York Times bestselling author of IBM and the Holocaust, The Transfer Agreement, and War Against the Weak. His journalism has appeared in the Washington Post, The Village Voice, The Sunday Times (of London), and The Los Angeles Times.</p><p>"Every hour spent reading Banking on Baghdad will be well rewarded. The historical detail is fascinating; Edwin Black&#x2019;s mastery of it reads like a detective story and thriller combined, and the relevance of the past has seldom been so graphically portrayed. This is a gripping expos�e of historic follies, fantasies, and ferocity, taking place in a region that is today still a focus and storm center as it has so often been. Oil forms a twisting thread of wealth, corruption, and greed. The cast of characters and their bizarre behavior could come out of a novel; but this is fact not fiction, more endlessly intriguing and absorbing than any novel could be."<br> &#x2013;Sir Martin Gilbert, author of Churchill: A Life, Israel: A History, The First World War: A Complete History, and The Second World War: A Complete History <p>Praise for Edwin Black&#x2019;s Prior Books</p> <p>On IBM and the Holocaust:</p> <p>"An explosive new book... Backed by exhaustive research, Black&#x2019;s case is simple and stunning: that IBM facilitated the identification and roundup of millions of Jews during the 12 years of the Third Reich....Black&#x2019;s evidence may be the most damning to appear yet against a purported corporate accomplice."<br> &#x2013;Michael Hirsh, Newsweek</p> <p>"Black has tracked down document after document witnessing that Holleriths inventoried prisoners for death at Bergen-Belsen and other concentration camps....IBM and the Holocaust is a disturbing book&#x2013;all the more so because its author doesn&#x2019;t prescribe what should be done about sins committed more than half a century ago. It is left to readers to decide."<br> &#x2013;Ron Grossman, The Chicago Tribune</p> <p>On War Against the Weak:</p> <p>"Edwin Black, author of the radical and revelatory IBM and the Holocaust, is a dangerous man. He tells us things we don&#x2019;t want to hear, like, for instance, this:<br> &#x2018;The scientific rationales that drove killer doctors at Auschwitz were first concocted on Long Island.&#x2019; His groundbreaking War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America&#x2019;s Campaign to Create a Master Race is a scary and necessary book."<br> &#x2013;Adrienne Miller, Esquire</p> <p>"In a new book, War Against the Weak, investigative reporter Edwin Black makes the case that 20th Century American proponents of eugenics...had substantive ties to the architects of Hitler&#x2019;s racial extermination machine... Black lays bare the veins of collaboration between American eugenicists and Nazi scientists."<br> &#x2013;Dan Vergano, USA Today</p>In Banking on Baghdad, New York Times and international bestselling author Edwin Black chronicles the dramatic and tragic history of a land long the center of world commerce and conflict. Tracing the involvement of Western governments and militaries, as well as oil, banking, and other corporate interests, Black pinpoints why today, just as throughout modern history, the world needs Iraq&#x2019;s resources&#x2013;and remains determined to acquire and protect them. Banking on Baghdad almost painfully documents the many ways Iraq&#x2019;s recent history mirrors its tumultuous past. <p>Now, with foreign troops once more occupying the "cradle of civilization," Banking on Baghdad gives us the opportunity to consider the present and future of Iraq through the lens of its complicated and turbulent history. While demonstrating that Iraq&#x2019;s tribal, religious, and political turmoil has combined to punish the nation, Black does not shy away from the uncomfortable truth that foreign governments&#x2013;including our own&#x2013;have played a defining role in creating the Iraq we know today. With his trademark mix of deeply mined history and investigative journalism, Black documents a long record of war profiteering in Iraq and takes a hard look at the corporations currently doing business there. With access to numerous oil company archives, the papers of a half dozen governments, and numerous other primary sources yielding some 50,000 documents, Banking on Baghdad tells a monumental story 7,000 years in the making.</p> <p>From the annihilation of Baghdad by the Mongol Horde in 1258 to the lightning charge of American battle tanks in 2003, Iraq&#x2019;s history is defined by the blood spilt on its soil. Now, Banking on Baghdad provides the historical context lacking from the political discourse in the news media and in Washington circles. It persuasively argues that Iraq&#x2019;s future is inextricably linked to its tempestuous history, and that the ongoing conflict there may become just another tragic chapter in that country&#x2019;s long and calamitous record.</p></p><h2>Byzantium and Islam: Age of Transition</h2><p><p>This groundbreaking volume explores the epochal transformations and unexpected continuities in the Byzantine Empire from the seventh to the ninth century. As the period opened, the Empire's southern provinces&#x2014;the vibrant, diverse areas of North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean&#x2014;were at the crossroads of trade routes reaching from Spain to China. These regions experienced historic upheavals when their Christian and Jewish communities encountered the emerging Islamic world, and by the ninth century, an unprecedented cross-fertilization of cultures had taken place.</p><p>This extraordinary age is brought vividly to life by&nbsp;leading international scholars, their writings accompanied by sumptuous illustrations of the period's most notable arts and artifacts. Resplendent images of authority, religion, and trade&#x2014;embodied in precious metals, brilliant textiles, fine ivories, elaborate mosaics, manuscripts, and icons, many of them never before published&#x2014;highlight the dynamic dialogue between the rich array of Byzantine styles and the evolving Islamic aesthetic.

Long famous for their colossal heads carved from giant boulders, the Olmecs have fascinated the public and archaeologists alike since the 1940s when National Geographic magazine reported the initial explorations of their centers. Despite well-publicized discoveries of spectacular basalt sculptures, portable jade objects, and richly decorated pottery vessels, until recently almost nothing was known about Olmec history, foreign contacts, and daily life. Now archaeologists have recovered information that allows them to assemble a reasonably complete picture of Olmec culture and its impact on later Mexican civilizations.<br> The Olmecs established the first cities in the Americas on high ground overlooking the rivers that meander across southeastern Mexico's fertile coastal lowlands. Between the thirteenth and sixth centuries BC, rulers of San Lorenzo and La Venta oversaw the construction of palaces, pyramids, plazas, richly stocked tombs, and religious sanctuaries, and commissioned hundreds of sculptures carved from raw basalt. Thousands of Olmec farmers supported themselves and their leaders by growing maize and other domesticated plants.

Holden narrates the story of a couple of days in his sixteen-year-old life, just after he's been expelled from prep school, in a slang that sounds edgy even today and keeps this novel on banned book lists. It begins,<br> <p> "If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them." </p><p> His constant wry observations about what he encounters, from teachers to phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation.</p>J D Salinger was born in 1919.

For Wilson, the Shroud's ultimate significance resides in the very fact of Christians' fascination with it. The Shroud represents the possibility that the Resurrection actually happened; if there's any chance the Shroud is authentic, and if that chance excites you, then historical facts are a crucial aspect of your faith. Given that, the Shroud of Turin becomes much more than a curiosity for cranks and crazies. It's a valuable incitement to introspection for all believers. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Ian Wilson was born in London in 1941 and educated at Emanuel School, Wandsworth, and Magdalene College, Oxford, where he graduated in History in 1963.

By examining in particular the independent small business sector or petite bourgeoisie, using Progressive Era Portland, Oregon, as a case study, Robert Johnston shows that class still matters in America. But it matters only if the politics and culture of the leading player in affairs of class, the middle class, is dramatically reconceived.</p><br><p> This book is a powerful combination of intellectual, business, labor, medical, and, above all, political history. Its author also humanizes the middle class by describing the lives of four small business owners: Harry Lane, Will Daly, William U'Ren, and Lora Little. Lane was Portland's reform mayor before becoming one of only six senators to vote against U.S. entry into World War I. Daly was Oregon's most prominent labor leader and a onetime Socialist. U'Ren was the national architect of the direct democracy movement. Little was a leading antivaccinationist.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Radical Middle Class</i> further explores the Portland Ku Klux Klan and concludes with a national overview of the American middle class from the Progressive Era to the present. With its engaging narrative, conceptual richness, and daring argumentation, it will be welcomed by all who understand that reexamining the middle class can yield not only better scholarship but firmer grounds for democratic hope.</p></p><p><p>"A historical tour de force of the Progressive era in a middle class city, Professor Johnston's book will begin to unravel the stultifying stereotyping of the middle classes and remove cobwebs of inaction from the minds of today's civic organizers and thinkers."<b>--Ralph Nader</b></p><p>"This is one of the most original, provocative, and imaginative works about the modern U.S. that I have read in years. Johnston has produced far more than a splendid history about the neglected politics of a neglected city. His book is studded with insights about what it meant and means to be middle class and the fecund nature of populism in industrial and post-industrial America. What is more, he gives us hope for the future."<b>--Michael Kazin, Georgetown University, author of <i>The Populist Persuasion: An American History</i></b></p><p>"Johnston's daring, meticulous, subtle, and analytically acute study of Portland's lower middle class leaves hundreds of shallow and condescending cliches about the petite bourgeoisie mortally wounded or gasping for breath in its splendid wake. He succeeds in restoring the historical autonomy, particularity, and egalitarian moral economy of America's lower middle classes. As with E.P. Thompson's history of the English working class, subsequent work on the middle class in America must now take this study as its point of departure."<b>--James C. Scott, author of <i>Seeing Like a State</i></b></p><p>"Johnston seizes the Progressive Era and gives it back to the people. He argues that the roots of reform flourished among average citizens, those who thought that they could change the world by reasoning and voting together. This is a book about democracy at its best. Johnston recalls America's potential and underscores the paramount importance of civic activism on the local level."<b>--Glenda E. Gilmore, editor of <i>Who Were the Progesssives?</i> and author of <i>Gender and Jim Crow</i></b></p><p>"In this very exciting study, Johnston has truly broken new ground. For all its theoretical sophistication, the book is written with flair and is blessedly free of arcane jargon. The prose is clear, powerful, and even jaunty at times. <i>The Radical Middle Class</i> will become one of those rare and important books that no scholar of U.S. class relations and politics will be able to ignore."<b>--Elaine Tyler May, author of <i>Homeward Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era</i></b></p><p>"Robert Johnston has written a terrific book, engaging one of the most neglected and important topics in U.S. history: the political history of the middle class. More successful than some of his predecessors, he gives middle-class Americans the history they so richly deserve.

More often than not, these glazed splashes of color are made of terra cotta, which, for more than 100 years, has been an integral�but largely unknown�part of America's architectural legacy. Beginning in the nineteenth century, peaking in the Art Deco period, and enjoying a renaissance today, terra cotta has been used to ornament facades, rooflines, doors, and windows and create many of the most famous and fanciful architectural reliefs.?<p>?<i>Terra-Cotta Skyline</i> presents the history, manufacture, and art of architectural terra cotta through documents, drawings, archival photographs, and brilliant new color images commissioned exclusively for this book. Also included is a catalog of 200 extant terra-cotta buildings in New York, as well as directories of terra-cotta manufacturers and preservation organizations.</p></p><p>As any urbanite can attest, it is often those inspired instances of architectural ornamentation--on facades, rooflines, doors, windows, and relief work--that can bring a dull gray cityscape to life. Many of the ornaments gracing historic New York buildings are made of glazed terra cotta, which has been an integral (though largely overlooked) part of America&#39;s architectural legacy for more than a century, particularly in the art deco period. This volume, which is firmly on the side of preservation rather than demolition, reveals and celebrates the splendor of those architectural treasures. Offering a fascinating history, the book chronicles the development of terra-cotta ornamentation from the artisans of the late 19th century, to the revival the medium is enjoying today both in restoration projects and in new construction, to the efforts of preservationists to save this threatened aspect of architectural history. Also included is a detailed listing of 200 significant terra-cotta buildings in New York City.Susan Tunick is the president of the organization Friends of Terra Cotta.

These were neither idle nor idyllic years; the discovery of Lascaux in 1940 coincides with the bloodiest war in history&#x2015;with new machines of death, Auschwitz, and Hiroshima. Bataille's reflections on the possible origins of humanity coincide with the intensified threat of its possible extinction. For Bataille, prehistory is universal history; it is the history of a human community prior to its fall into separation, into nations and races. The art of prehistory offers the earliest traces of nascent yet fully human consciousness&#x2015;of consciousness not yet fully separated from natural flora and fauna, or from the energetic forces of the universe. A play of identities, the art of prehistory is the art of a consciousness struggling against itself, of a human spirit struggling against brute animal physicality. Prehistory is the cradle of humanity, the birth of tragedy. Bataille reaches beyond disciplinary specializations to imagine a moment when thought was universal. Bataille's work provides a model for interdisciplinary inquiry in our own day, a universal imagination and thought for our own potential community. <i>The Cradle of Humanity: Prehistoric Art and Culture</i> speaks to philosophers and historians of thought, to anthropologists interested in the history of their discipline and in new methodologies, to theologians and religious comparatists interested in the origins and nature of man's encounter with the sacred, and to art historians and aestheticians grappling with the place of prehistory in the canons of art.</p></p><p>Georges Bataille (1897-1962) was a French writer, essayist, and philosopher whose works include <i>The Story of the Eye</i>, <i>The Blue of Noon</i>, <i>The Accursed Share</i>, and <i>Theory of Religion</i>.Fans of the filthy modernist masterpiece The Story of The Eye may be surprised when they encounter Bataille (1897-1962) in an almost academic mode-but, if so, they are forgetting that Bataille was the founder of the journal Critique, that he was a librarian specializing in Medievalism at Paris's Biblioth�que Nationale and that all that transformed primitivism had to come from somewhere. This book may not have much value as archeology or even as criticism, but it's terrific as a kind of poetics of prehistory. On animals: "we get along with one another in order to eliminate death, to rid it from our horizon, to create an end in the world in which it would be as if the animal's agony and death were nonexistent." Drawing on the cave paintings of Lascaux, the Lespugue Venus and many other works, Bataille articulates a world that is simultaneously ours and unrecoverable, where those who kill their prey ask it "to forgive them for killing it, and sometimes they cry for it, in a touching mixture of distracted sincerity and simple playacting." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>The Virtual Window</i>, Anne Friedberg examines the window as metaphor, as architectural component, and as an opening to the dematerialized reality we see on the screen.</p><p>In <i>De pictura</i> (1435), Leon Battista Alberti famously instructed painters to consider the frame of the painting as an open window. Taking Alberti's metaphor as her starting point, Friedberg tracks shifts in the perspectival paradigm as she gives us histories of the architectural window, developments in glass and transparency, and the emerging apparatuses of photography, cinema, television, and digital imaging. Single-point perspective&#x2015;Alberti's metaphorical window&#x2015;has long been challenged by modern painting, modern architecture, and moving-image technologies. And yet, notes Friedberg, for most of the twentieth century the dominant form of the moving image was a single image in a single frame. The fractured modernism exemplified by cubist painting, for example, remained largely confined to experimental, avant-garde work. On the computer screen, however, where multiple 'windows' coexist and overlap, perspective may have met its end.</p><p>In this wide-ranging book, Friedberg considers such topics as the framed view of the camera obscura, Le Corbusier's mandates for the architectural window, Eisenstein's opinions on the shape of the movie screen, and the multiple images and nested windows commonly displayed on screens today. <i>The Virtual Window</i> proposes a new logic of visuality, framed and virtual: an architecture not only of space but of time.</p></p><p>Anne Friedberg was Professor of Critical Studies in the School of Cinematic Arts, University of Southern California, and the author of <i>Window Shopping: Cinema and the Postmodern</i>.<p>The digital revolution has globalized a word and a nation that Leon Battista Alberti first translated from the realm of building to that of representation in 1435. anne friedberg's wide-ranging and masterly book shows that the recent renaissance of Alberti's 'window' is neither coincidence nor simple homonymy. From linear perspective to moving pictures to split screens, from see-through to light-receiving and light-emitting devices, Friedberg brilliantly demonstrates that the virtual window has been the most successful single tool for mimesis, command, and control in the history of Western civilization.</p>&#x2015;<b>Mario Carpo</b>, Ecole d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette<br><br><p>Unlike most theorists of digital culture, Anne Friedberg brings a deeply historical perspective to the visual metaphors of our wired world. <i>The Virtual Window</i> charts transformations in visual knowledge leading from Renaissance perspective to today's computer desktops by tracking shifts in the physical and philosophical meaning of 'windows.' Its long view offers an important methodological model to media studies and art history alike.</p>&#x2015;<b>David Joselit</b>, history of Art, Yale University<br><br><p><i>The Virtual Window</i> is, quite simply, brilliant. Even as Friedberg employs an interdisciplinary historical sweep that most scholars would be incapable of, she offers grounded and very tightly focused discussions of specific theories and visual practices related to the use of windows and screens from the Renaissance to the age of new media.</p>&#x2015;<b>John Caldwell</b>, Professor, Department of Film, Television, and Digital Media, University of California, Los Angeles</p><h2>A Matter of Principle</h2><p><p>This is a book about the interplay of urgent political issues and hotly debated questions of moral philosophy. The controversies it joins are old; but history has given them fresh shape. For example, whether judges should and do make law is now of more practical importance than ever before, as recent presidents have appointed enough justices to the Supreme Court to set its character for a generation.</p><p>With forceful style, Ronald Dworkin addresses questions about the Anglo-American legal system as protector of individual rights and as machinery for furthering the common good. He discusses whether judges should make political decisions in hard cases; the balancing of individual rights versus the good of the community; whether a person has the right to do what society views as wrong; and the meaning of equality in any framework of social justice. Dworkin strongly opposes the idea that judges should aim at maximizing social wealth. It is his conviction that the area of discretion for judges is severely limited, that in a mature legal system one can always find in existing law a &#x201c;right answer&#x201d; for hard cases.</p><p>Dworkin helps us thread our way through many timely issues such as the rights and privileges of the press under the First Amendment. He reviews the <i>Bakke</i> case, which tested affirmative action programs. These essays also examine civil disobedience, especially in nuclear protests, and bring new perspective to the debate over support of the arts.</p><p>Above all, this is a book about the interplay between two levels of our political consciousness: practical problems and philosophical theory, matters of urgency and matters of principle. The concluding essay on press freedom expands the discussion of conflict between principle and policy into a warning. Though some defenders of the press blend the two in order to expand freedom of speech, the confusion they create does disservice to their aim and jeopardizes the genuine and fragile right of free speech. We stand in greater danger of compromising that right than of losing the most obvious policy benefits of powerful investigative reporting and should therefore beware the danger to liberty of confusing the two. The caution is general. If we care so little for principle that we dress policy in its colors when this suits our purpose, we cheapen principle and diminish its authority.</p></p><p>This is a book about fundamental theoretical issues of political philosophy and jurisprudence: about what liberalism is and why we still need it; whether we should be skeptical about law and morality; how collective prosperity should be defined; what interpretation is and how far law is a matter of interpretation rather than invention. It is also a practical book about urgent political issues. It is above all, a book about the interplay between these two levels of our political consciousness: practical problems and philosophical theory, matters of urgency and matters of principle.Ronald Dworkin was Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law and Philosophy at New York University.</p><h2>The Dark Side Of The Screen: Film Noir</h2><p>Foster Hirsch's <i>Dark Side of the Screen</i> is by far the most thorough and entertaining study of the themes, visual motifs, character types, actors, directors, and films in this genre ever published. From Billy Wilder, Douglas Sirk, Robert Aldrich, and Howard Hawkes to Martin Scorsese, Roman Polanski, and Paul Schrader, the noir themes of dread, paranoia, steamy sex, double-crossing women, and menacing cityscapes have held a fascination. The features that make Burt Lancaster, Joan Crawford, Robert Mitchum, and Humphrey Bogart into noir heroes and heroines are carefully detailed here, as well as those camera angles, lighting effects, and story lines that characterize Fritz Lang, Samuel Fuller, and Orson Welles as noir directors.For the current rediscovery of film noir, this comprehensive history with its list of credits to 112 outstanding films and its many illustrations will be a valuable reference and a source of inspiration for further research.</p><p>Foster Hirsch, the author of fifteen books on film and theater, among them <i>The Dark Side of the Screen: Film Noir</i> and <i>Kurt Weill on Stage</i> , lives in New York City.&#34;Wonderfully readable: Hirsch is clear, knowledgeable, and concise...

Students first learn grammar and vocabulary intuitively through extended contextual reading and an innovative system of marginal notes. It is the only textbook currently available that gives students the opportunity to learn Latin without resorting to translation, but allows them to think in the language. It is also the most popular text for teachers, at both the secondary and collegiate levels, who wish to incorporate conversational skills into their classroom practice. <p> </p><p>Part I, Familia Romana contains thirty-five chapters and describes the life of a Roman family in the 2nd century A.D., and culminate in readings from classical poets and Donatus&#x2019;s Ars Grammatica, the standard Latin school text for a millennium. Each chapter is divided into two or three lectiones (lessons) of a couple pages each followed by a grammar section, Grammatica Latina, and three exercises or Pensa. Hans Oerberg&#x2019;s impeccable Latinity, humorous stories, and the Peer Lauritzen illustrations make this work a classic. The book includes a table of inflections, a Roman calendar, and a word index, index vocabulorum. </p><p> </p><p>Lingua Latina incorporates the following features: </p><p>- The most comprehensive treatment of Latin grammar available in an elementary textbook. </p><p>- A vocabulary of almost 1,800 words, reinforced by constant and creatively phrased repetition, vastly expands the potential for later sight reading. </p><p>- A complete line of ancillary volumes, exercises, and readers both in print and online. </p><p> </p><p>Paperback Edition.</p></p><p>Entirely composed in Latin, Part I, Familia Romana, provides an excellent introduction to Latin, including the essentials of Latin grammar and a basic vocabulary of over 1500 words.

In explicitly tying the policy realm to management skills, <strong>Shannon Vaughan </strong>and <strong>Shelly Arsneault&#x2032;s </strong>foundational book sheds new light on how nonprofit managers can better navigate policymaking and regulatory contexts to effectively lead their organizations. <br><br><strong><em>Managing Nonprofit Organizations in a Policy World </em></strong>provides a comprehensive overview of the nonprofit sector and the policy environment, with a focus on skills and strategies managers can use to advance the causes of their organizations. Abundant examples and rich case studies explore the complexity of the policy-nonprofit relationship and highlight both management challenges and successes. While coverage of the nuts-and-bolts is in here, what sets this book apart is tying everyday management to the broader view of how nonprofits can thrive within the policy ecosystem.</p><p></p><h2>King John: The Oxford Shakespeare</h2><p>Edited by the eminent A.R. Braunmuller, this thorough edition of <em>King John</em>--the first scholarly edition in almost fifteen years--makes a significant contribution to the study of Shakespeare's works. Braunmuller offers a wide-ranging critical introduction, which focuses on the play's political relevance in Elizabethan England, its relationship to legal issues of the day, its treatment of women and families, and its overall aesthetic importance in Shakespeare's early career. He also provides a richly detailed stage history, full annotations that are especially sensitive to the play's language and staging, and an ample bibliographical study of the Folio (1623) text. The most comprehensive and up-to-date edition of <em>King John</em> currently available, this book is an invaluable resource for Shakespearean scholars, students, and theatergoers alike.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>The play&#39;s political importance, rich and varied language and skillful design are analyzed through the examination of several disputed emendations to the text in this exhaustive stage history.Shakespeare&#39;s King John is a curious play in that it has no obvious villain or hero, though the King himself shares some of the qualities of both. From the point of view of a modern reader, brought up to regard the wresting of Magna Carta from King John as the most important event in his reign, Shakespeare&#39;s complete omission of any mention of this aspect of King John&#39;s struggle with the barons will also seem odd.</p><h2>The Apocryphal New Testament: A Collection of Apocryphal Christian Literature in an English Translation</h2><p>This collection of apocryphal texts supersedes the best-selling edition by M.R. James, which was originally published in 1924. Several new texts have come to light since 1924 and the textual base for some of the apocrypha previously translated by James is now more secure, as in several cases there are now recently published critical editions available. Although a modest addition to James's edition was made in 1953, no thorough revision has previously been undertaken. In this volume, J.K. Elliott presents new translations of the texts and has provided each of them with a short introduction and bibliography for readers who wish to pursue further the issues raised in the texts or to consult the critical editions, other translations, or general studies. The translations are in modern English, in contrast to James's deliberate imitation of the language of the Authorized Version. The collection is designed to give readers the most important or famous of the Christian apocrypha and a small sample of gnostic texts. Full translations of the earliest texts are printed, as well as some derivative apocrypha.<br></p><p>This collection of apocryphal texts supersedes the best-selling edition by M. R.

But the world&#x2019;s best-loved female authors are usually mythologized as solitary eccentrics or isolated geniuses. Coauthors and real-life friends Emily Midorikawa and Emma Claire Sweeney prove this wrong, thanks to their discovery of a wealth of surprising collaborations: the friendship between Jane Austen and one of the family servants, playwright Anne Sharp; the daring feminist author Mary Taylor, who shaped the work of Charlotte Bront�; the transatlantic friendship of the seemingly aloof George Eliot and Harriet Beecher Stowe; and Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield, most often portrayed as bitter foes, but who, in fact, enjoyed a complex friendship fired by an underlying erotic charge.<br><br> Through letters and diaries that have never been published before, <i>A Secret Sisterhood</i> resurrects these forgotten stories of female friendships. They were sometimes scandalous and volatile, sometimes supportive and inspiring, but always&#x2014;until now&#x2014;tantalizingly consigned to the shadows.</p><p>Writers and friends EMILY MIDORIKAWA and EMMA CLAIRE SWEENEY co-run the website SomethingRhymed.com.

What is the relationship between language and the world? How do metaphors work? <em>The Philosophy of Language</em>, considered the essential text in its field, is an excellent introduction to such fundamental questions. This revised edition collects forty-one of the most important articles in the field, making it the most up-to-date and comprehensive volume on the subject. The fourth edition features several new articles including influential work by Bertrand Russell, John R. Searle, John Perry, Ruth Garrett Millikan, and John Stuart Mill. Other selections include classic articles by such distinguished philosophers as Gottlob Frege, P. F. Strawson, J. L. Austin, Hilary Putnam, and David Kaplan. <br> The selections represent evolving and varying approaches to the philosophy of language, with many articles building upon earlier ones or critically discussing them. Eight sections cover the central issues: Truth and Meaning; Speech Acts; Reference and Descriptions; Names and Demonstratives; Propositional Attitudes; Metaphor; Interpretation and Translation; and The Nature of Language. The revised general introduction and introductions to each section give students background to the issues and explain the connections between them. A list of suggested further reading follows each section.</p><p>A. P. Martinich is at University of Texas, Austin.&#34;After nurturing several generations of philosophy of language students, this is arguably still the best sourcebook in the field.

Inspiring and practical, the Discourses provide an ever-fresh framework of spiritual perspective on the challenges of everyday life. As Meher Baba stated, "Words that proceed from the Source of Truth have real meaning." <b>The Discourses</b> bear eloquent testimony to that fact and will remain an incomparable companion for those seeking spiritual direction.</p><p>Meher Baba&#39;s Discourses throw the light of true knowledge on many of life&#39;s most perplexing problems. Inspiring and practical, the Discourses provides an ever-fresh framework of spiritual perspective on the challenges of everyday life. As Meher Baba said, &#34;Words that proceed from the Source of Truth have real meaning.&#34; Discourses bears eloquent testimony to that fact and after 50 years in print remains an incomparable companion for anyone seeking spiritual direction.(1894-1969) Merwan Sheriar Irani known as Meher Baba, was born in Pune, India, on February 25, 1894, of Persian parents. His father, Sheriar Irani, was of Zoroastrian faith and a true seeker of God. Merwan went to a Christian high school in Pune and later attended Deccan College. In 1913 while still in college, a momentous event occurred in his life...the meeting with Hazrat Babajan, an ancient Mohammedan woman and one of the five Perfect Masters of the Age. Babajan gave him God-Realization and made him aware of his high spiritual destiny. <p>Eventually he was drawn to seek out another Perfect Master, Upasni Maharaj, a Hindu who lived in Sakori. During the next seven years Maharaj gave Merwan "Gnosis" or Divine Knowledge. Thus Merwan attained spiritual Perfection. His spiritual mission began in 1921 when he drew together his first close disciples. It was these early disciples who gave him the name Meher Baba, which means "Compassionate Father". </p><p>After years of intensive training of his disciples, Meher Baba established a colony near Ahmednagar that is called Meherabad. Here the Master's work embraced a free school where spiritual training was stressed, a free hospital and dispensary, and shelters for the poor. No distinction was made between the high castes and Untouchables; all mingled in common fellowship through the inspiration of the Master. To his disciples at Meherabad, who were of different castes and creeds, he gave a training of moral discipline, love for God, spiritual understanding and selfless service. </p><p>Meher Baba told his disciples that from July 10, 1925 he would observe Silence. Since that day he maintained his Silence until his death in 1969. His many spiritual discourses and messages have been dictated by means of an alphabet board. Much later the Master discontinued the use of the board and reduced all communication to hand gestures unique in expressiveness and understandable to many. </p><p>Meher Baba has traveled to the Western world six times, first in 1931, when he contacted his early Western disciples. His last visit to American was in 1958 when he and his disciples stayed at the Center established for his work at Myrtle Beach, S.C. </p><p>In India as many as one hundred thousand people have come in one day to seek his Darshan, or blessing; from all over the world there are those who journey to spend a few days, even a single day, in his presence. </p><p>An important part of Meher Baba's work through the years has been to personally contact and to serve hundreds of those known in India as "masts". These are advanced pilgrims on the spiritual path who have become spiritually intoxicated from direct awareness of God. For this work he has traveled many thousands of miles to remote places throughout India and Ceylon. Other vital work has been the washing of the lepers, the washing of the feet of thousands of poor and the distribution of grain and cloth to the destitute. </p><p>Meher Baba asserts that he is the same Ancient One, come again to redeem man from his bondage of ignorance and to guide him to realize his true Self which is God. Meher Baba is acknowledged by his many followers all over the world as the Avatar of the Age.</p></p><h2>Physical Chemistry: Quantum Chemistry and Molecular Interactions</h2><p><p>Fostering an intuitive understanding of chemistry, <b> <i>Physical Chemistry:&nbsp;Quantum Chemistry and Molecular Interactions</i> </b>&nbsp;presents the structure and unity of the theoretical framework of modern chemistry in a progression from the single atom to the bulk limit.

Iphigenia at Aulis. Rhesus (Loeb Classical Library No. 495)</h2><p><p>One of antiquity's greatest poets, Euripides has been prized in every age for the pathos, terror, and intellectual probing of his dramatic creations. This volume completes the new six-volume Loeb Classical Library edition of his plays. </p><p>In <i>Bacchae</i>, a masterpiece of tragic drama, Euripides tells the story of king Pentheus's resistance to the worship of Dionysus and his horrific punishment. <i>Iphigenia at Aulis</i> recounts the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter to Artemis, the price exacted by the goddess for favorable sailing winds. <i>Rhesus</i> (probably not by Euripides) dramatizes a pivotal incident in the Trojan War.

This collection of 24 great fairy tales from 16 different countries--Iceland to Zimbabwe, Turkey to Japan--has been selected by folklorist Philip from Lang's Colored Fairy Books. Unlike other Lang collections, such as the <i>Rainbow Fairy Book</i> (1993), newly illustrated by Michael Hague, this volume contains the original lush romantic paintings and line drawings by Henry Justice Ford. And, unlike Hague, Philip deliberately excludes the well-known stories, such as "Cinderella" and "Rumpelstiltskin," choosing instead a rich collection of world stories that will be new to many readers. They're amazing stories, beautifully told, drawing the reader in as they've always done from the first sentence. The book is handsomely designed for reading alone or for sharing in classroom, library, and home, with thick paper and clear type. In brief notes at the back, Philip gives a few facts about sources and points out some common tale types and motifs. These tales endure not because of role models or messages but because they're great stories. The universals of heroes and monsters and perilous journeys are presented in all their wonderful particularity and variety. As Philip points out in his brief introduction, "Once upon a time" is now. <i>Hazel Rochman</i>Grade 4 Up-Culled from Lang's 12 "color" fairy tale books, this remarkable collection features the full-color paintings and line drawings from the originals and covers a wide geographic range. An introduction provides background on Lang and the 24 tales, as well as good source notes for each one. The language is poetic and may prove challenging to some readers, but it does offer a rich source of vivid imagery. Ford's illustrations demonstrate the Pre-Raphaelite influence on his work and are so consistent with the tales that text and art form an integrated whole. The Rainbow Fairy Book (Morrow, 1993), illustrated by Michael Hague, is a comparable anthology. While it has more stories (31), they are more familiar ones, including "Hansel and Gretel," "Rapunzel," and "Cinderella." Only two are duplicated. Hague's volume has a similar introduction and a bibliography that gives early sources but does not indicate which book each story comes from. Librarians would be justified in purchasing both.<br><i>Donna L.

On the surface a witty, bantering tale, this eighteenth-century classic is actually a savage, satiric thrust at the philosophical optimism that proclaims that all disaster and human suffering is part of a benevolent cosmic plan. Fast, funny, often outrageous, the French philosopher's immortal narrative takes Candide around the world to discover that &#x2014; contrary to the teachings of his distinguished tutor Dr. Pangloss &#x2014; all is not always for the best. Alive with wit, brilliance, and graceful storytelling, <i>Candide</i> has become Voltaire's most celebrated work. <br><br></p></p><p><i>Candide</i>, the wittiest and best-loved book of a genius who is still unequaled in his ability to spin art out of philosophy, became a huge bestseller in Europe after it was published in 1759. Voltaire, skeptical of the systems of philosophy that were floated about to explain the workings of the world, used this satirical story about the optimist Candide and his friend Dr. Pangloss to interrogate and discredit the philosophies and approach more closely the truth about human life, suffering, and happiness in the real world. Now, the short novel <i>Candide</i> is considered one of the most important texts of the enlightenment.The spirit of satire flourished during the Enlightenment as in no other period, and the crowning achievement of that caustic, brilliantly learned age was Voltaire&#39;s Candide, published in 1759, at the height of its author&#39;s enormous European fame. Following the worldwide encounters - with shipwrecks, earthquakes, pestilence, and human insanity - of its hero and his incomparably absurd tutor, Dr. Pangloss, Candide is the most entertaining of all philosophical novels and the most philosophical of entertainments.</p><h2>Secret Medicines from Your Garden: Plants for Healing, Spirituality, and Magic</h2><p>A guided exploration of herbal lore and healing plants found in yards, forests, meadows, and hedgerows<br><br>� Draws on traditional knowledge and remedies from around the world, including Native American, Celtic, and Egyptian traditions<br><br>� Provides simple recipes to safely make herbal remedies from local plants and honey for first aid, immune support, and treatment of common ailments<br><br>� Details the &#x201c;triangle&#x201d; formula-making system of William LeSassier<br><br>� Explains how to work with plant spirits, herbal astrology, and Animal Spirit Medicine<br><br>Weaving together ancient wisdom, mystical folklore, and modern plant research, master herbalist Ellen Evert Hopman explores the many uses of flowers, trees, common weeds, and ornamental plants for food, medicine, spiritual growth, and magical rituals.

It might, in fact, seem downright offensive. What? Turn the focus away from my children and onto myself? Isn&#x2019;t that against all the rules?<br><br>No, it isn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m not proposing that you put your children last on the list. Far from it. What I am saying is that by focusing on yourself, you will have a healthier, happier relationship with your whole family.<br><br>You see, most of us have been operating with a faulty model of how to live in our relationships. That&#x2019;s not to say our relationships are all faulty, but the model sure is. We&#x2019;ve been operating with a model that says in order to have healthy relationships, we need to focus on meeting other people&#x2019;s needs, trying to serve them and make them happy.<br><br>To even question such a model draws controversy, I know, but stay with me. By focusing on yourself, you will have a healthier, happier relationship with your whole family.<br><br>This book is going to talk about why this model is so faulty, particularly in our parent-child relationships. For now, there are a few simple things we should consider. First, it&#x2019;s a given that there are things in this world we can control and things we cannot control. Now ask yourself this question: How smart is it to focus your energy on something you can&#x2019;t do anything about, something you cannot control? <br><br>Answer: Not very. <br><br>Follow-up question: Which category do your kids fall into? In other words, are your children something you can control or something you cannot control? Here&#x2019;s an even tougher question: Even if you could control your kids, should you? Is that what parenting is all about? And what if it&#x2019;s not the kids who are out of control?<br><br>A fundamental assertion of this book is that God wants us to parent our children the way he parents us. Think about how he relates to you. Does he constantly hover around you trying to make you completely comfortable? Is God some kind of control freak, pulling your strings and manipulating your every choice? Of course not! God is concerned about you, but he does not allow you to set his agenda. He always acts out of his own integrity. What would your relationships look like if you started to do the same?<br><br>Who&#x2019;s Really Out of Control Here?<br><br>My kids, Hannah and Brandon, were four and two, and it was one of <i>those </i>Saturday mornings. My wife, Jenny, and I had stayed up way too late on Friday night, which guaranteed that our kids would get up way too early the next day. And so the weekend began with a lot of whining and crying and complaining&#x2013;and the kids were upset as well.<br><br>So I decided, in my parenting expert wisdom, to get us all out of the house. Let&#x2019;s go to Waffle House for breakfast.<br><br>Now the first Waffle House we walked into was just too full, but, thankfully, there is no shortage of Waffle Houses in suburban Atlanta. So, we piled back into the car, strapped our children into their car seats, quieted disappointed whines with promises of lots of maple syrup, and drove the hundred yards or so to a second Waffle House. And the line at the second one was just as long as the first.<br><br>There was no way we were getting the kids back into the car for another trip, however, so we decided to wait it out. Thankfully, the staff at this Waffle House were thinking&#x2013;they had crayons and blank paper for the kids. My wife and I could even get in a little adult conversation. A win-win situation.<br><br>As if that weren&#x2019;t enough, a sign caught my eye. If my children drew a picture, they were entitled to a paper Waffle House hat&#x2013;just like the grill man wears&#x2013;and a free waffle.<br><br>Sometimes life is good. The kids colored. My wife and I talked. The time flew and before we knew it, we were seated&#x2013;my wife and daughter on one side of the booth, my son and I on the other. They brought the kids their paper hats, and I even tried one on.<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve never been to a Waffle House, you would be amazed at the consistency of their architecture. All the tables surround the kitchen, and wall-length windows surround the tables. It&#x2019;s very open, and it&#x2019;s easy to notice the goings-on of others.<br><br>Now, while I was feeling pretty good by this time, my kids hadn&#x2019;t eaten anything all morning. Hungry kids who&#x2019;ve done nothing but wait around can be...restless. Hannah, our four-year-old, handled it all right, just garden-variety complaints. But Brandon, our two-year-old, sure was feeling two years old, if you know what I mean. Two-year-olds generally have no regard for things like &#x201c;practicing an inside voice&#x201d; or &#x201c;using words like a big boy&#x201d; when they&#x2019;ve been forced in and out of a car with nothing to eat but promises. Cooperating with me was not high on his list of priorities at the time. Enjoying a nice family breakfast didn&#x2019;t seem like such a good idea now.<br><br>But I&#x2019;m a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist. I&#x2019;m a relationship coach. I know how to control myself and keep from losing my temper. I know better than to react and resort to yelling and violent acts of coercion. I can stay calm in the face of increasing levels of anxiety. But then my son threw his fork on the floor. My resolve began to fade.<br><br>The fork made a loud noise, causing all the people around us to look at me. Some of them even pointed and whispered (at least that&#x2019;s what it felt like they were doing). I looked over at my perfect wife sitting there with my perfect daughter. There is an unwritten rule among parents with multiple kids: Whoever is sitting on your side is on your watch. So while the women in my life are enjoying this angelic scene of cooperation and intimacy, my son and I are on the verge of World War III.<br><br>Nothing is making him happy, nothing is stopping him from the beginning stages of an all-out tantrum. Finally, his waffle arrives and I think the battle will be over soon. So, I start to cut the waffle up, but he doesn&#x2019;t want the waffle cut up. Maybe he wants to eat the whole thing with his hands in one bite, I don&#x2019;t know. I do know I&#x2019;m feeling closer and closer to my own emotional edge.<br><br>But I&#x2019;m the expert on human relationships, right? I&#x2019;m the one planning to write a book someday called <i>ScreamFree Parenting</i>. Was I going to allow a two-year-old to push my buttons? You bet I was. See, the fork got such a great response, my son began to wonder what might happen if he threw his waffle&#x2013;plate and all&#x2013;on the floor.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s what might happen: Daddy might lose his cool! And that&#x2019;s precisely what did happen.<br><br>I hastily apologized to the people with syrup splatter on their feet and then snatched Brandon out of his booster seat. Then I apologized to the man sitting in the booth behind us after Brandon&#x2019;s foot hit him in the back of the head.<br><br>And then we stormed out of the restaurant. All eyes were fixed on us as my son kept screaming. And kicking. And hitting.<br><br>I was seething as I pushed the door open with such force that it rattled the glass walls. The reverberating structure got everyone&#x2019;s attention. The entire restaurant saw me outside on the sidewalk, yelling at my son, using big words, asking rhetorical questions, puffing out my chest, pointing my finger, and intimidating a boy who couldn&#x2019;t have stood more than thirty-six inches tall. What a big man I was!<br><br>Finally, somehow, the ugly scene ended. Brandon and I returned to our seats to complete our nice family breakfast. And there sat Jenny, my loving and faithful wife. I think she wanted to say something supportive and reassuring, but she just couldn&#x2019;t contain the smirk. I was a volcano looking for an excuse to erupt.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I barked.<br><br>&#x201c;Nice hat.&#x201d;<br><br>It was then that I realized the paper Waffle House hat still sat squarely on top of my head. The entire scene had taken place with a silly hat on top of a silly man who wanted nothing more than to be taken seriously.<br><br><b>Our Biggest Enemy as Parents<br></b>Truth be told, I didn&#x2019;t need the hat to make me look foolish. I had done that myself with my knee-jerk reactivity. In fact, that kind of emotional reaction is our worst enemy when it comes to having great relationships. Let me say that again: <i>Emotional reactivity is our worst enemy when it comes to having great relationships</i>.<br><br>If you don&#x2019;t get anything else from this book, get this: Our biggest struggle as parents is not with the television; it&#x2019;s not with bad influences; it&#x2019;s not even with drugs or alcohol. Our biggest struggle as parents is with our own emotional reactivity. That&#x2019;s why the greatest thing we can do for our kids is learn to focus on us, not them. Instead of anxiously trying to control our kids, let&#x2019;s concentrate on what we can control&#x2013;calming our own emotional, knee-jerk reactions.<br><br>What&#x2019;s so damaging about being too reactive? Keep reading. The next couple of chapters will make it clear. For now, consider this: How can we have any influence on our children&#x2019;s decision-making if we don&#x2019;t have an influence on our own? When we get reactive, we get regressive. That is, we shrink back to an immature level of functioning. <br><br>Think of me at Waffle House. In an effort to get my two-year-old to stop acting so immaturely, I became just as immature. How effective can that be? I&#x2019;ve come to realize that if I get loud and scary and intimidating, I may get compliance eventually, but at what price? I may have screamed my son into submission at Waffle House, but what type of relationship will I have with him if I continue to parent by reactive intimidation? If we want to be influential, then we have to first bring ourselves under control. Only then can we choose our response.<br><br>Only then can we choose how we want to behave, regardless of how our children choose to behave. Think about Jesus. He was constantly being misunderstood. His authority was frequently called into question. He had plenty of people trying to derail him from his mission and goal. But he refused to let them push his buttons. He knew who he was, where he had come from, and what he was going to do. If people wanted to follow him, he encouraged them. If people wanted to walk away, no matter how sad it may have made him, he let them walk away. Because he refused to manipulate or coerce, he maintained the moral authority needed to be the greatest influence the world has ever known.<br><br>So if emotional reactivity is our biggest enemy, where does it come from? More important, what can we do about it? Most of us cannot think of a more terrifying emotion than feeling overwhelmed. We can feel scared, exhausted, worried, or angry, but nothing shuts us down, stops us in our tracks, and causes us to throw up our hands in futility like feeling overwhelmed. When we feel incapable of coping with, handling, or accomplishing all we have to do, we are overwhelmed. When it seems as if even if we weren&#x2019;t so tired and so frustrated we still couldn&#x2019;t keep all the plates spinning, that&#x2019;s about as scary as it gets. When we feel stretched beyond our limits, that&#x2019;s when we just want to quit.<br><br>And I can think of no more accurate description of how most of us parents feel far too much of the time. Far too often, we feel overwhelmed. We feel overstretched, overcommitted, underprepared, and underappreciated. That&#x2019;s a recipe for feeling overwhelmed. As a result, most of us feel a gnawing sense of inadequacy. We don&#x2019;t just feel like bad parents, we feel like failures.<br><br>And unfortunately, our role as parents is the one area of life where we cannot afford to fail. If there is one area where we feel the pressure of absolute success, it is with our parenting.<br>After all, we are bombarded with messages about the importance of time with our kids, involvement in our kids&#x2019; lives, and putting our family first among our priorities.<br><br>Magazines are crammed with articles dispensing the newest parenting techniques and advice. Studies consistently show the ill effects of bad parenting. Churches preach the need to put families first. With all of this pressure comes just more fear and feelings of inadequacy.<br><br>And then there&#x2019;s the most intense pressure of all: How we do as parents will reverberate throughout history. We are raising the next generation, and they will either continue the success and progress of past generations or they will erase it all. Anyone feeling overwhelmed?<br><br>Parenting is serious business. The stakes are unbelievably high. The cost of failure is unimaginable. I know you feel the intense weight of performing as a parent. You may wonder if you&#x2019;re the only one who sometimes feels inadequate, even inept. You may wonder: Is it supposed to be this hard? The answer is yes. And no. Yes, parenting is hard, and it&#x2019;s supposed to be. We&#x2019;ll get to that in the next few chapters.<br><br>But no, we don&#x2019;t have to feel this much pressure. We don&#x2019;t have to feel overwhelmed.<br><br><b>The Most Damaging Lie About Parenting <br></b>The reason we feel so overwhelmed is because most of us are attempting to follow an impossible model. And it is fueled by a dangerous lie. Here is the most damaging lie about parenting: We are responsible <i>for </i>our children.<br><br>I know that to even question such a statement sounds ridiculous. &#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m responsible for my kids...who else would be?&#x201d; I can only ask you to bear with me and keep reading.<br><br>You see, most people would define parenting like this: &#x201c;It is our job as parents to get our children to think, feel, and, especially, behave the right way. It is our job to get our children to be good.&#x201d; Of course that&#x2019;s right, right? Wrong.<br><br>Now, let me be clear. In my experience working with families, I&#x2019;ve seen the devastating effects of terrible parenting on now-grown adults. Certainly we have a profound amount of influence on how our kids turn out. This book will illustrate the power we have to shape our children. In fact, I don&#x2019;t think we can overestimate this influence we have on future generations.<br><br>But what that really means is that we have a far greater responsibility <i>to </i>our children than we have <i>for </i>our children. Let me say that again, so it will sink in. We are much less responsible <i>for </i>our children than we&#x2019;ve ever been told.<br><br>However, we have a far greater responsibility <i>to </i>our children than we&#x2019;ve ever realized. Most of us feel like we&#x2019;re responsible <i>for </i>our children. Sure, they&#x2019;re totally dependent on us right from the beginning. But let&#x2019;s think about that for a moment. If we are responsible <i>for </i>our children, then we have a really big problem. How long did it take you to realize that your child had a mind of her own? Early on, our children start to make their own choices. This is part of growing up. In truth, this <i>is </i>growing up. Even in infancy our kids start to embrace their God-given ability to make decisions about what they will and will not do. They begin to choose how they feel, how they think, and how they behave.<br><br>I know this concept is simplistic, but it carries all the seeds of our frustration in raising kids. They simply make different choices than we want them to make! They choose to yell and scream in the grocery store. They choose not to do their homework. They c...</p><h2>Alices Adventures In Wonderland</h2><p>This classic tale of a little girl&#39;s adventure is full of imagination. A smiling Cheshire cat, screaming Queen of Hearts, and always-late White Rabbit keep the reader engrossed from one fantastic scene to the next. Classic illustrations included.</p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

But by the early 1800s, China had fallen so far behind the West in gunpowder warfare that it was easily defeated by Britain in the Opium War of 1839&#x2013;42. What happened? In <i>The Gunpowder Age</i>, Tonio Andrade offers a compelling new answer, opening a fresh perspective on a key question of world history: why did the countries of western Europe surge to global importance starting in the 1500s while China slipped behind?</p><p>Historians have long argued that gunpowder weapons helped Europeans establish global hegemony. Yet the inhabitants of what is today China not only invented guns and bombs but also, as Andrade shows, continued to innovate in gunpowder technology through the early 1700s&#x2015;much longer than previously thought. Why, then, did China become so vulnerable? Andrade argues that one significant reason is that it was out of practice fighting wars, having enjoyed nearly a century of relative peace, since 1760. Indeed, he demonstrates that China&#x2015;like Europe&#x2015;was a powerful military innovator, particularly during times of great warfare, such as the violent century starting after the Opium War, when the Chinese once again quickly modernized their forces. Today, China is simply returning to its old position as one of the world's great military powers.</p><p>By showing that China&#x2019;s military dynamism was deeper, longer lasting, and more quickly recovered than previously understood, <i>The Gunpowder Age</i> challenges long-standing explanations of the so-called Great Divergence between the West and Asia.</p></p><p><p>"China invented gunpowder, guns, and bombs, so how did the West overtake, defeat, and humiliate the Chinese by the nineteenth century? Tackling one of history's biggest unsolved mysteries, <i>The Gunpowder Age</i> is indispensable to debates in world history--and as exciting, dramatic, and engaging as a novel."<b>--Jared Diamond, author of <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i></b></p><p>"This is a marvelous book and one of the most enjoyable works of military history, Chinese history, and East/West comparison that I have read in years. The reader learns many wonderful things, from the impressive history of early gunpowder weapons in China to China's ability to consistently defeat European expeditions in the 1600s. Andrade makes an original and vitally important contribution to debates about these fields and subjects."<b>--Jack Goldstone, author of <i>Why Europe? The Rise of the West in World History, 1500-1850</i></b></p><p>"At last we have a history of gunpowder that has been reconstructed as it should be, from both ends of the Eurasian continent. With the vigilance of the good historian and the zest of the good storyteller, Tonio Andrade argues brilliantly that the gunpowder age was as much the creation of China as of Europe. Let the controversy begin."<b>--Timothy Brook, author of <i>Mr. Selden's Map of China</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Gunpowder Age</i> is an important revisionist history that brings together a very impressive amount of new information and interpretation, and will be essential reading, much debated and built on by scholars of the early modern histories of both Europe and China."<b>--John E. Wills, Jr., author of <i>1688: A Global History, and The World from 1450 to 1700</i></b></p><p>"Tonio Andrade's engaging book overturns much received wisdom about gunpowder warfare and the West's 'Military Revolution.' Examining the development of gunpowder weapons in China and Europe, he shows that the Chinese consistently experimented with and adopted new weapons to suit their needs, but that their dynamic empire eventually fell victim to its own military successes. This is a must-read for anyone interested in the relationship between war, society, and state in Asia or Europe."<b>--Kenneth M. Swope, author of <i>The Military Collapse of China's Ming Dynasty, 1618&#x2013;44</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Gunpowder Age</i> is history that reads like a detective novel, telling a fascinating story that transforms our understanding of the impact of weapons technology."<b>--S.C.M.

Topics include but are not limited to the creation of male and female, including harmonious personal relationships, equality in personhood and importance, and difference in role and authority; equality and differences in the Trinity; the essential nature of man; and our inherited guilt and corruption because of Adam&#x2019;s sin.

When it was written, however, German Expressionism seemed like an eccentric manifestation far removed from what was then considered the mainstream of modern art. But as historians well know, each generation alters the concept of mainstream to encompass those aspects of the past which seem most relevant to the present. The impact of German Expressionism on the art and thought of later generations could never have been anticipated at the time of the original writing of this book. During the subsequent years an enormous body of scholarly research and an even larger number of popular books on German expressionist art has been printed. Numerous monographs and detailed studies on most of the artists exist now and countless exhibitions with accompanying catalogues have taken place. Much of this new research could have been incorporated in a revised edition and the bibliography certainly could have been greatly expanded to include the important writings which have been published in Germany, the United States and elsewhere since this book was originally issued. The author, however, was faced with the choice of reprinting the original text with only the most necessary alterations-such as updating the captions to indicate present locations of the paintings-or the preparation of a revised text and bibliography. Desirable as a revision appeared, present printing costs would have priced the paperback out of reach for students. It is for this reason that I decided to reissue the original text which stands on its own as a primary investigation of German Expressionist Painting.</p><p>"Selz has given us the final documentation of the Expressionist movement. Based on a thorough investigation of all documents available, on personal and written interviews with the surviving artists or members of their families, the book has established the story of the unfolding of Expressionism step by step."--<i>Journal of Aesthetics and Criticism</i>&nbsp;"Mr. Selz has undertaken an exhaustive examination of the movement in Dresden, Munich, and Vienna . . . he uncovers much that is unfamiliar and presents what we already know in a meaningful historical perspective. His scholarship is dazzling and will earn him the gratitude of everyone who works in the field."--<i>Yale Review</i><b>Peter Selz</b> was Art historian of German Expressionism and Professor of Art History, University of California, Berkeley, 1965-1988.</p><h2>Iola Leroy: Or Shadows Uplifted (The Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers)</h2><p><strong>The Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers</strong><br>General Editor: HENRY LOUIS GATES, JR.<br> The past two decades have seen a dramatic resurgence of interest in black women writers, as authors such as Toni Morrison and Alice Walker have come to dominate the larger African-American literary landscape. Yet the works of the writers who founded and nurtured the black women's literary tradition--nineteenth-century African-American women--have remained buried in research libraries or in expensive hard-to-find reprints, often inaccessible to twentieth-century readers.<br> Oxford University Press, in collaboration with the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, a research unit of The New York Public Library, rescued the voice of an entire segment of the black tradition by offering thirty volumes of these compelling and rare works of fiction, poetry, autobiography, biography, essays, and journalism. Responding to the wide recognition this series has received, Oxford now presents four more of these volumes in paperback (to add to the four already available). Each book contains an introduction written by an expert in the field, as well as an overview by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., the General Editor.<br></p><p><br><strong>Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</strong> is W.

Presenting an <em>other world</em> of information on how to cast spells and mix potions, this fascinating volume speaks to our age as we experience a renaissance of interest in the occult.<br> Compiled in Latin near the end of the thirteenth century and translated into all major European languages, the book first appeared in English around 1550 and was subsequently reprinted many times over the next ninety years. The various sections, which include herbs, stones, beasts, astrology, and the "marvels of the world," offer wonderful descriptions of, for example, how to gather the Marigold herb in the month of August, wrap it in the leaf of a Laurel or Bay tree, and add a wolf's tooth to it in order to prevent anyone from speaking ill of you; or how to rid your home of mice by "perfuming" it with the hoof of a horse. Appearing at a time of growing knowledge and skepticism, this work served as a reminder that magic and the improbable still greatly interested much of the literate public.

In this edition Colin Macleod tries to reach both scholars and Greekless readers alike. In his commentary he gives help to readers unfamiliar with the language of Homer and discusses problems of content and expression, never treating this book in isolation but drawing attention to Homer&#39;s artistry and thought in the context of the whole of the Iliad. In his introduction Mr Macleod examines Homer&#39;s notion of poetry, his style and language and the architecture and meaning of his work. He tries to show why Book XXIV is a proper conclusion to the Iliad. This is an edition for classical scholars, undergraduates and students in the upper forms of schools. The introduction and substantial parts of the commentary require no knowledge of Greek and should find readers among all who are interested in European literature.</p><p>A detailed edition of the last book of the Iliad includes a full commentary and introduction, which provide guidance and assistance with literary background and linguistic points.Text: Greek</p><h2>Vladimir Nabokov: Selected Letters 1940-1977</h2><p>Over four hundred letters chronicle the author's career, recording his struggles in the publishing world, the battles over "Lolita," and his relationship with his wife. <br></p><p>If Vladimir Nabokov's fiction merits any criticism, it is for its iciness. The master himself declared in a 1977 BBC interview, "My characters cringe as I come near them with my whip. I have seen a whole avenue of imagined trees losing their leaves at the threat of my passage." Nabokov's correspondence, however, reveals a far warmer individual, though one ever-ready with a verbal shiv. This volume begins with a 1923 letter to his mother, written while he was a farmhand in the French Alps, and ends with a 1977 letter sent to his wife, Vera, for Mother's Day: "My dearest, your roses, your fragrant rubies, glow red against a background of spring rain..." <p> Nabokov's son, Dmitri, and Matthew Bruccoli have created the fullest, and by far the most amusing, portrait of the serious artist as trickster. There's the famous letter to Burma-Vita, in which Nabokov offers the company an advertising jingle (alas, they turned him down). There's the best, and most amusing, account of "l'affaire <i>Lolita</i>." Here is his response to his <i>New Yorker</i> editor, Katharine White: "Let me thank you very warmly for your frank and charming letter about LOLITA. But after all how many are the memorable literary characters whom we would like our teen-age daughters to meet? Would you like our Patricia to go on a date with Othello? Would we like our Mary to read the New Testament temple against temple with Raskolnikov? Would we like our sons to marry Emma Rouault, Becky Sharp or <i>La belle dame sans merci</i>?" </p><p> In another letter, however, he takes care to thank White for a "chubby check." (One wishes this phrase had gained greater circulation.) Nabokov again and again comes off as a difficult author, challenging his publishers left, right, and center over issues large (and there were many) and as well as those that were niggling. Calling the British paperback cover of <i>Laughter in the Dark</i> "atrocious, disgusting, and badly drawn besides having nothing to do whatever with the contents of the book," he tells his U.K. publisher, "I would appreciate if you would use your influence and have them substitute a pretty dark-haired girl, or a palmtree, or a winding road, or anything else for this tasteless abomination." Still, one is most often convinced that he's right, even when he makes the large claim that the French film <i>Les Nymphettes</i> infringes on his rights, "since this term was invented by me for the main character in my novel <i>Lolita</i>." </p><p> Not only is this volume endlessly quotable, it also reads like a great epistolary novel--fraught with high thought, high drama, and the delightfully unexpected. Who would have guessed that Nabokov would ask Hugh Hefner, "Have you ever noticed how the head and ears of your Bunny resemble a butterfly in shape, with an eyespot on one hindwing?"</p>Vladimir Nabokov (1899-1977), Russian-born poet, novelist, literary critic, translator, and essayist was awarded the National Medal for Literature for his life&#39;s work in 1973. He taught literature at Wellesley, Stanford, Cornell, and Harvard. He is the author of many works including Lolita, Pale Fire, Ada, and Speak, Memory.</p><h2>Henry V (Oxford School Shakespeare Series)</h2><p>This edition of Shakespeare's <em>Henry V, </em>features detailed explanations of multiple passaages, words, and scences making the play accesible and easier to understand.

Under the patronage of Queen Elizabeth I, he penned more than 30 plays, 154 sonnets, and numerous narrative poems and short verses. Equally accomplished in histories, tragedies, comedy, and romance, Shakespeare's most famous works include Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear, The Taming of the Shrew, and As You Like It.<p>Like many of his contemporaries, including Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare began his career on the stage, eventually rising to become part-owner of Lord Chamberlain's Men, a popular dramatic company of his day, and of the storied Globe Theatre in London.</p><p>Extremely popular in his lifetime, Shakespeare's works continue to resonate more than three hundred years after his death. His plays are performed more often than any other playwright's, have been translated into every major language in the world, and are studied widely by scholars and students.</p></p><h2>Teaching Drama: The Essential Handbook: 16 Ready-to-Go Lesson Plans to Build a Better Actor</h2><p>Are you a new drama teacher looking for help planning your first year?

What were the specific "tricks" and "tools" I could use to go beyond "having fun" to actually building better actors? Eventually I realized the thing that was most helpful to me was to watch other amazing teachers in action. Nothing could replace the experience of being in the classroom and seeing what worked and what didn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is designed to recreate that experience.

Think Again. If you think sex education is still about the birds and the bees, think again. And it's not about science either. In her shocking expos�, You're Teaching My Child What?, Dr. Miriam Grossman rips back the curtain on sex education today, exposing a sordid truth. Today's sex ed programs aren't based on science; they're based on liberal lies and politically correct propaganda that promote the illusion that children (yes, children) can be sexually free without risk. As a psychiatrist and expert on sexual education, Dr. Grossman cites example after example of schools and organizations whitewashing&#x2014;or omitting altogether&#x2014; crucial information that doesn't fit in with their "PC" agenda. Instead, sex educators only tell teens the "facts of life" that promote acceptance, sexual exploration, and experimentation. What sex educators call an education, scientists would call a scam: � Sex educators won't tell girls their bodies are biologically and chemically more susceptible to STDs; they will only say 3 million girls have a sexually transmitted infection � Educators say it's natural for children to "explore" their sexuality from a young age and only they can decide when it's right to have sex&#x2014;the real truth is neurobiologists say teen brains are not developed to fully reason and weigh consequences, especially in "the heat of the moment" � Teens are told condoms, vaccines and yearly testing provide adequate protection, without being told that studies now show condoms are no match for herpes, HPV and gonorrhea In You're Teaching My Child What?, Dr. Grossman reveals biological truths that you won't find in today's classrooms. You're Teaching My Child What? is critical reading for parents with teens and instrumental in teaching children the truth about sex.

Dr. Miriam Grossman examines what the powerful sex education industry teaches your child, and what she finds will make your hair curl. Do you have a child in school? With this book you'll understand the destructive agendas of so-called `scientific' sex ed, then you'll learn what your kids really need to know: politically incorrect truths that blow those agendas out of the water. Finally, a doctor who's brave enough to break ranks and call foul. We owe her a standing ovation."<br>--Dr. Laura Schlessinger, Author and host of a nationally syndicated radio program</p><p>"Dr. Miriam Grossman is a bright, bold, but solitary beacon revealing the avalanche of faulty sex education and counseling that is endangering the physical and emotional health of our young people and corrupting their futures. This is an alert that all parents must read, and an antidote that our young people can use against those so-called experts who would indoctrinate them."<br>--Nicholas A. Cummings, Ph.D., Sc.D. Former President, American Psychological Association</p><p>"The sex education lobby systematically undermines traditional morality and aggressively promotes an ideology of sexual license while pretending to be concerned only with the health and safety of young people. The sad truth is that by subtly (and sometimes not-so-subtly) encouraging and often facilitating adolescent sexual activity, the sex ed establishment jeopardizes the physical and emotional health of children as well as their moral and spiritual welfare. It is high time that someone stepped forward to expose much contemporary sex education for what it is, namely, a series of catechism classes for the pseudo-religion of sexual liberationism. Dr. Miriam Grossman has done just that. This bold and brilliant physician has done the nation and its children a great service. Everyone who believes, as I do, in the importance of childhood innocence and safety, and the sound moral development of young men and women, owes Dr. Grossman an enormous debt."<br>--Robert P. George, McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence and Director of the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions, Princeton University</p>If you think sex education is still about the birds and the bees, you're wrong.

If you're a parent with children in the public school system, you need to know what's really going on.<p>In <i>You're Teaching My Child What?</i> Dr. Miriam Grossman rips back the curtain on sex education today, exposing a sordid truth. Instead of teaching our children the facts of life, sex educators are lying to them, ignoring medical fact in favor of politicized, and dangerous, propaganda that could ruin your child's life forever.</p><p>In <i>You're Teaching My Child What?</i> you'll learn what sex educators don't want you to know:</p><p>* Why the discredited founder of "sexology"--dead for half a century--has more influence on sex education than today's most eminent neurobiologists<br>* How information your child gets about common infections like herpes, warts, and Chlamydia is whitewashed<br>* When "safe sex" isn't safe: why condoms won't protect your teens from some of the most serious sexually transmitted diseases <br>* How sex educators try to normalize fringe behaviors--ignoring the health risks to your children</p><p>The sex education establishment would like to lull you into thinking that they know best--but the epidemic of sexually transmitted infections in young people today is testimony to a system that's gone mad.</p><p>Parents need to arm themselves and their children with the facts--the real facts of life. In <i>You're Teaching My Child What?</i> Dr. Miriam Grossman does just that, in an essential book to inform yourself and protect your children.</p></p><h2>Messier&#39;s Nebulae and Star Clusters (Practical Astronomy Handbooks, Series Number 2)</h2><p>Charles Messier&#39;s catalog of nebulae and star clusters, published in 1784, marked the start of a new era of deep-sky astronomy.

As he wanders the streets of Zagreb in a near-hallucinatory state of paranoia and malnourishment, Melkior encounters a colorful circus of characters&#x2014;fortune-tellers, shamans, actors, prostitutes, bohemians, and caf� intellectuals&#x2014;all living in a fragile dream of a society about to be changed forever.</p><p>A seminal work of postwar Eastern European literature, <i>Cyclops </i>reveals a little-known perspective on World War II from within the former Yugoslavia, one that has never before been available to an English-speaking audience. Vlada Stojiljkovic's able translation, improved by Ellen Elias-Bursac's insightful editing, preserves the striking brilliance of this riotously funny and densely allusive text. Along Melkior&#x2019;s journey <i>Cyclops</i> satirizes both the delusions of the righteous military officials who feed the national bloodlust as well as the wayward intellectuals who believe themselves to be above the unpleasant realities of international conflict. Through Stojiljkovic's clear-eyed translation, Melkior&#x2019;s peregrinations reveal how history happens and how the individual consciousness is swept up in the tide of political events, and this is accomplished in a mode that will resonate with readers of Charles Simic, Aleksandr Hemon, and Kundera.</p></p><p><p><b>Ranko Marinkovic</b> (1913&#x2013;2001) was a Croatian writer of plays and novels. <b>Vlada Stojiljkovic</b> wrote eleven books for children and adults, several of which he illustrated; translated Orwell, Swift, Golding, and Lear; and was an illustrator and painter. <b>Ellen Elias-Bursac</b> has been translating Croatian, Serbian, and Bosnian authors into English for more than twenty years.</p>"Marinkovic splices scenes of dream and reality into a kaleidoscopic short history of the world, whose pessimism is tempered by dark humor."&#x2014;<i>The New Yorker<br></i> (<i>The New Yorker</i>)<br><br>"One of the most outstanding Croatian novels of the postwar period."&#x2014;Valentina Zanca, <i>Words Without Borders</i> (Valentina Zanca <i>Words Without Borders</i>)<br><br>"Among the most highly regarded novels of postwar Croatian literature. . . .The style is the point [of the novel], especially as it conveys the psychological intensity, the nihilism, of that place and time."&#x2014;M.

Here, Bernard d'Espagnat argues that quantum physics--by casting doubts on once hallowed concepts such as space, material objects, and causality-demands serious reconsideration of most of traditional philosophy.</p><br><br><p> <i>On Physics and Philosophy</i> is an accessible, mathematics-free reflection on the philosophical meaning of the quantum revolution, by one of the world's leading authorities on the subject. D'Espagnat presents an objective account of the main guiding principles of contemporary physics-in particular, quantum mechanics-followed by a look at just what consequences these should imply for philosophical thinking.</p><br><p> The author begins by describing recent discoveries in quantum physics such as nonseparability, and explicating the significance of contemporary developments such as decoherence. Then he proceeds to set various philosophical theories of knowledge--such as materialism, realism, Kantism, and neo-Kantism--against the conceptual problems quantum theory raises. His overall conclusion is that while the physical implications of quantum theory suggest that scientific knowledge will never truly describe mind-independent reality, the notion of such an ultimate reality--one we can never access directly or rationally and which he calls "veiled reality"--remains conceptually necessary nonetheless.</p></p><p><p>"This book is a monument to d'Espagnat's excellent work and style; it is surely the most complete book to have been written on this subject and one likely to last a long time, at least until we come to fully understand the remaining mysteries in the field."<b>--Roland Omn�s, Professor Emeritus of Theoretical Physics, Universit� de Paris-Sud</b></p><p>"Bernard d'Espagnat is an accomplished theoretical physicist and philosopher, whose two disciplines are interrelated in the present book. He conclusively argues that features of quantum mechanics--particularly the Uncertainty Principle, the nonlocality exhibited by entangled systems, and the measurement problem--revolutionize epistemology and metaphysics. His novel and lucid philosophy, called 'veiled realism,' criticizes Kant's doctrine of synthetic a priori knowledge but shares the thesis that scientific knowledge provides empirical regularities while pointing to an underlying 'noumenal' reality whose structure is not revealed."<b>--Abner Shimony, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Physics, Boston University</b></p><p>"With exceptional scientific, historical, and philosophical insights, d'Espagnat examines the implications of recent developments in quantum physics for philosophy and the implications of philosophical reflections for the understanding of fundamental physics. D'Espagnat's book not only challenges ingrained ways of thinking; it is indeed a visionary and critical reorientation for both physics and philosophy."<b>--Tian Yu Cao, Boston University</b></p><p>"D'Espagnat has performed an intellectual feat by distilling the essential conceptual puzzles of quantum mechanics into a few core principles without relying on any mathematical formalism, and in a very readable style at that. At the same time, this book is not some trendy everyman's guide to the exotic features of quantum physics, with some philosophical commentary--but a work of mature scholarship."<b>--Jeffrey Bub, University of Maryland, author of <i>Interpreting the Quantum World</i></b></p><p>"Here, d'Espagnat discusses virtually all the central philosophical issues related to quantum mechanics and its interpretation. The book is nontechnical, presupposing no previous knowledge of science or philosophy. It is a pleasure to read."<b>--Andrew Z. Wayne, University of Guelph, coeditor of <i>Ontological Aspects of Quantum Field Theory</i></b></p><p>"This book takes the theme of d'Espagnat's influential <i>Veiled Reality</i> and develops it into a 'world view,' as he calls it.

Its five thousand men, cooped up for the longest at-sea tour of the war, rioted--or, as <i>Troubled Water </i>suggests, mutinied. Disturbingly, the lines were drawn racially, black against white.

With the influx of Portuguese, Dutch, and Italian merchants, missionaries, and explorers, Kongo developed a unique artistic tradition that blended European iconography with powerful indigenous art forms. An initially positive engagement with Europe in the 15th century turned turbulent in the wake of later displacement, civil war, and the slave trade&#x2014;and many of the artworks created in Kongo reflect the changing times.<br> &nbsp;<br> This comprehensive study is the first major catalogue to explore Kongo&#x2019;s history, art forms, and cultural identity before, during, and after contact with Europe. Objects range from 15th-century &#x201c;mother-and-child&#x201d; figures, which reflect a time when Europeans and their Christian motifs were viewed favorably, to fearsome <i>mangaaka</i>, power figures that conveyed strength in the midst of the kingdom&#x2019;s dissolution.

The double-bind of female authority--that a women cannot be both a healthy adult and an ideal woman-- is the context in which a woman must construct her self in this culture. Whether she sees herself as "too needy" or "too controlling," "too insecure" or "too self-reliant," she is gathering evidence to support a theory of personal inadequacy. The traditional perspectives of psychodynamics and psychopathology reinforce women's sense of inferiority. How then does a woman claim her own authority-- the validity of her own truth, beauty, goodness, originating in her own experience. <br>Young-Eisendrath and Wiedemann break with the tradition of "deficit thinking," the examination of what is absent, wrong, or deficient. Recognizing this as a fundamental barrier to the empowerment of women, they work instead from an understanding of what is already strong and satisfying in the lives of women and girls in a patriarchal society. This volume unravels the paradox of female authority through the examination of its sociocultural, symbolic, and personal dimensions. Chapters 1 through 4 present a re-visioning of the female self, using the psychologies of C. G. Jung and Jane Loevinger as major theoretical frameworks. The authors argue for a modification of Jung's concept of "animus'' --the repressed masculine in the girl or woman--and in chapters 5 through 8 present a detailed model of psychotherapy based on five stages of animus development. Using a wealth of clinical material from their own practices --including two extended case presentations in chapters 9 through 11-- the authors skillfully illustrate their own efforts to help women assume greater personal authority. The book's concluding chapter presents New Texts and Contexts for Female Development. <br>Unique in its combination of feminist theory, social psychology, and Jungian psychology, FEMALE AUTHORITY offers a fresh approach to the analysis of gender concerns in identity. The book will be of great value to practitioners and theoreticians in the human services. The discussion of women's self-esteem and personal authority, and the probing of conflicts inherent in female identity in our society, place this book among the major recent contributions to the development of a psychology of women.<br></p><p>Polly Young-Eisendrath, PhD, has published and lectured extensively.

His many biographers have provided countless conflicting interpretations of his dark life, but virtually all agree on one thing: Hitler's formative experience was his service in World War I. Unfortunately, historians have found little to illuminate this critical period. Until now. <br><br>In <em>Hitler's First War</em>, award-winning author Thomas Weber delivers a master work of history--a major revision of our understanding of Hitler's life. Weber paints a group portrait of the List Regiment, Hitler's unit during World War I, to rewrite the story of his military service. Drawing on deep and imaginative research, Weber refutes the story crafted by Hitler himself, and so challenges the historical argument that the war led naturally to Nazism. Contrary to myth, the regiment consisted largely of conscripts, not enthusiastic volunteers. Hitler served with scores of Jews, including noted artist Albert Weisberger, who proved more heroic, and popular, than the future F�hrer. Indeed, Weber finds that the men shunned Private Hitler as a "rear area pig," and that Hitler himself was still unsure of his political views when the war ended in 1918. Through the stories of such comrades as a soldier-turned-concentration camp commandant, veterans who fell victim to the Holocaust, an officer who became Hitler's personal adjutant in the 1930s but then cooperated with British intelligence, and the veterans who simply went back to their Bavarian farms and never joined the Nazi ranks, Weber demonstrates how and why Hitler aggressively policed the myth of his wartime experience. <br><br>Underlying all Hitler studies is a seemingly unanswerable question: Was he simply a product of his times, or an anomaly beyond all calculation? Weber's groundbreaking work sheds light on this puzzle and offers a profound challenge to the idea that World War I served as the perfect crucible for Hitler's subsequent rise.<br></p><p><br><strong>Thomas Weber</strong> is Lecturer in Modern European, International, and Global Political History at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland.

Ingredients are listed, followed by a suggestion of how much you might need. It includes a helpful section on where to get hold of everything worth eating.</p><p>What is there to say about a new Nigel Slater book? Especially one called <i>Appetite</i>. It is exactly what it should be. This is the book he has been heading for all along. It is about food, to be sure, but it is also a statement of his personal philosophy, which seems to amount to this: that our appetites are founded in pleasure; and that we must interrogate those pleasures, and take them very seriously indeed, if we are to eat as well as we can. To eat well means to eat, and cook, pleasurably. So in <i>Appetite</i> Slater takes food, and cooking, back to where he believes it belongs, back to the realm of sensuous pleasure and comfort. Back to the sheer bliss, as he might say, of putting something warm, soft, and sticky in your mouth.<p>Very cleverly, he has built his book not around detailed recipes as such--that would be too specific for his purposes--but around the sort of thing that might pop into your head as something you would really like to eat. These are the kinds of food this generous and handsome book celebrates; foods that have a genuine part to play in people's lives. This is quintessential Nigel Slater: laid-back, not claiming any special privilege as a chef ("If I can do it, so can you," he remarks), and all wrapped up in that wonderful, lived-in, squashy prose that hits the spot every time. A feast of a book, from a man with no tricks or gimmicks, who is happily in touch with his own appetites and wants to put us in touch with ours. <i>--Robin Davidson, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>?If you decide to go through life without cooking you are missing something very, very special. You are losing out on one of the greatest pleasures you can have with your clothes on.? ? Nigel Slater<br><br>A chance comment spurred the heralded <i>Observer</i> columnist and wildly popular cookbook author Nigel Slater to write <b>Appetite</b>. A reader asked ?If you don?t give me exact amounts in a recipe, then how will I know if it is right?? Slater realized the reader had so little confidence in his own cooking that he didn?t know what he liked unless he was told. <b>Appetite</b> is not about getting it right or wrong; it is about liking what you cook.<br><br>To help the everyday cook achieve culinary independence, Slater supplies the basics of relaxed, unpretentious, hearty cooking, written with his trademark humour and candour. Slater doesn?t believe in replicating restaurant-style theatricality to impress guests -- he simply loves food, and his love is evident on every page.<br><br>Slater covers the philosophies of cooking, the basics to have on hand, and detailed descriptions of necessary equipment and ingredients. He tells you which wok to buy (the cheap one), and why it can pay to flirt with the fishmonger. There are sections on seasoning, a good long list of foods that pair well, and a large collection of recipes for soup, pasta, rice, vegetables, fish, meat, pastry and desserts. These are straightforward, easy-to-make dishes adapted for the North American cook -- every one a springboard to something new, different and delicious. And with full-colour photography throughout the book, Appetite is a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.</p><h2>Modern Digital and Analog Communication Systems (The Oxford Series in Electrical and Computer Engineering)</h2><p>Lathi's trademark user-friendly and highly readable text presents a complete and modern treatment of communication systems.

Originally published fifteen years ago and the basis for an award-winning PBS documentary, this timely new edition arrives just as recent elections have left an ever-growing number of secular Americans wondering exactly how the other half thinks.<br> From Oregon to Florida, and from Texas to North Dakota, Balmer offers an immensely readable tour of the highways and byways of American evangelicalism. We visit a revival meeting in Florida, an Indian reservation in the Dakotas, a trade show for Christian booksellers, and a fundamentalist Bible camp in the Adirondacks.<br> For this fourth edition, Balmer adds two chapters, one on the phenomenally popular "Painter of Light," Thomas Kinkade, and one on Rick Warren, author of <em>The Purpose-Driven Life</em>. Through the eyes of these and other people Balmer meets on his journeys, we arrive at a more accurate and balanced understanding of an abiding tradition that, as the author argues, is both rich in theological insights and mired in contradictions. <em>Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory</em> offers readers a genuine insight into the appeal that the evangelicals movement holds for thousands of Americans.</p><p><br><strong>Randall Balmer</strong> is professor of American Religious History at Barnard College, Columbia University and a visiting professor at Yale Divinity School. An editor-at-large for <em>Christianity Today</em> magazine, his commentaries on religion in America have appeared in newspapers across the country, and he regularly lectures at colleges, universities, and at such venues as the Chautauqua Institution and the Smithsonian Associates. Dr. Balmer was nominated for an Emmy Award for writing and presenting the PBS version of this book.<br>"A professor of American religious history at Barnard and Columbia, Balmer wrote this book because he had a 'suspicion that many Americans, and certainly the media, really did not have much of a clue about who evangelicals were, what they believed, or what motivated their forays into the<br>political arena.' Fifteen years after the book was published, and with the gap between evangelicals and other Americans still yawning, the book offers a tour of evangelical enclaves throughout the country."--The Washington Post<br><br>"Randall Balmer takes readers through evangelical America, and it's a surprisingly lively and light ride. Balmer isn't a preacher, but a fine reporter, curious and respectful about the vitality and diversity of evangelicalism."--The New York Daily News (on previous edition)<br><br>"A sensitive, informed, often moving account of lifestyles and belief systems that coexist with--but are usually set apart from--secular mainstream America.... Provides a carefully crafted portrait of religious diversity that is both generous and critical but never patronizing.... We can all<br>read this book with profit."--Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography (on previous edition)<br><br>"Fascinating.... This is a wonderful book.... Fair, insightful and respectful.... Balmer understands what he sees, but has enough distance from his subject to be analytical. Outsiders will learn much from his carefully nuanced insights; and insiders will frequently have to nod their heads in<br>agreement: this man knows what he is talking about."--Church History (on previous edition)<br><br>"This compelling account makes Randall Balmer the William Least Heat Moon of American evangelicalism. Just as Blue Highways opened up an ordinary America beyond the bright city lights, so Balmer goes beyond media stars like Jerry Falwell, Billy Graham, and Jimmy Swaggart to illuminate the<br>local realities of evangelical life. The worlds of Protestant conservatives are complex--filled overfull with the eccentric and the authentic, locked tightly in the grip of kitsch as well as the grip of grace. In describing that world from Oregon to New Hampshire, Des Moines to Phoenix,<br>Mississippi to North Dakota--Balmer doesn't miss a nuance or a beat."--Mark A. Noll, Wheaton College<br><br>"Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory is a book about the sawdust trail that glitters like angel dust. It is witty, lively and richly informative--written with real style and sophistication, and a delight to read."--Frederick Buechner<br><br>"Easily the best participant-observer study of the evangelical landscape in contemporary America. He combines the insight of the trained historian with the deft instincts of the birthright insider. The product is at once a critical, painfully funny, warmly sympathetic exploration of the<br>multiple subcultures of a sprawling religious tradition that is all too easily stereotyped--and dismissed--as monolithic fundamentalism."--Grant Wacker, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill<br><br>"American evangelicalism is as diverse as the nation's landscape. Balmer's book is an extraordinary religious travelogue through that complicated subculture....After reading [his] book, popular stereotypes of 'evangelicals' and 'fundamentalists' will never again be quite so clearly<br>focused."--David E. Harrell, Jr., University of Alabama, Birmingham<br><br>"A powerful examination of those ingredients hat constitute the very essence of the phenomenon called American evangelicism.

Or that health insurance is too expensive, too uneven, too complicated&#x2014;and gives you too many forms to fill out. But the central problem is that too much medical care has too little value.<br><br> Dr. H. Gilbert Welch is worried about too much medical care. It&#x2019;s not to deny that some people get too little medical care, rather that the conventional concern about &#x201c;too little&#x201d; needs to be balanced with a concern about &#x201c;too much&#x201d;: too many people being made to worry about diseases they don&#x2019;t have&#x2014;and are at only average risk to get; too many people being tested and exposed to the harmful effects of the testing process; too many people being subjected to treatments they don&#x2019;t need&#x2014;or can&#x2019;t benefit from. <br><br> The American public has been sold the idea that seeking medical care is one of the most important steps to maintain wellness. Surprisingly, medical care is not, in fact, well correlated with good health. So more medicine does not equal more health; in reality the opposite may be true. <br><br> The general public harbors assumptions about medical care that encourage overuse, assumptions like it&#x2019;s always better to fix the problem, sooner (or newer) is always better, or it never hurts to get more information. <i>Less Medicine, More Health</i> pushes against established wisdom and suggests that medical care can be too aggressive. Drawing on his twenty-five years of medical practice and research, Dr. Welch notes that while economics and lawyers contribute to the excesses of American medicine, the problem is essentially created when the general public clings to these powerful assumptions about the value of tests and treatments&#x2014;a number of which are just plain wrong. <br><br>By telling fascinating (and occasionally amusing) stories backed by reliable data, Dr. Welch challenges patients and the health-care establishment to rethink some very fundamental practices. His provocative prescriptions hold the potential to save money and, more important, improve health outcomes for us all.</p><p><b>Dr. H. Gilbert Welch</b> is an academic physician, a professor at Dartmouth Medical School, and a nationally recognized expert on the effects of medical testing. He has been published in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>,<i> New York Times</i>,<i> Washington Post</i>, and <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and has appeared on <i>Today</i>. Dr. Welch is the author of three previous books, including the highly acclaimed <i>Overdiagnosed. </i>He lives in Thetford, Vermont.&#x201c;Avoiding medical jargon, Welch speaks directly to the layperson and focuses on certain assumptions that have increased consumption in a market-driven society; some of which have become so ingrained by popular media that refuting them seems downright scandalous...&nbsp;Welch&#x2019;s words, though wise beyond money, border on sacrilege in a country of generally healthy people who have developed an expensive health-care habit and who are expected to support a lucrative health-care industry. Welch&#x2019;s conversational style makes his prescription for better health an easy pill to swallow.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>, starred review<br><br>&#x201c;A bright, lively discussion of the excesses of medical care to which patients often unwittingly go due to certain false assumptions...&nbsp;Welch demonstrates the flaws in these assumptions. His stories involve the risks, uncertainties and harms of cancer screenings, treatments for heart disease, drugs, medical devices and surgical procedures. He makes an especially strong case for the risks of mass screenings for cancer&#x2014;the fear, the false alarms, the overdiagnoses and the resulting overtreatments. Vivid images make what could be discouragingly technical quite understandable...&nbsp;Welch's engaging style and touches of humor make this an easy read, and the facts he presents make a convincing case.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;Read this book. It is smart, witty, wonderfully written, and above all wise. We've overmedicalized life and yet we need medicine throughout our lives. No one explains better when we do, when we don't, and why.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Atul Gawande, author of <i>Complications</i> and <i>Being Mortal</i><br><br>&#x201c;Wise, witty, fascinating and alarmingly persuasive&#x2014;this is a book&nbsp;everyone should read, especially my doctor.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Bill Bryson, author of <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i><br><br>&#x201c;With the style of a trustworthy country doctor, Welch, an academic heavyweight, urges us to reject the allure of reducing all health risks by using the latest technology to gather all the data and to fix the problems sooner rather than later. Showing the dangers of our ill-informed enthusiasm for medicine, he brilliantly builds the case for respecting its power and limitations: to seek it when ill and all but avoid it when healthy.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Victor M. Montori, MD, Professor of Medicine, Mayo Clinic<br><br>&#x201c;Gil Welch's latest book shows us exactly how too much medical care can be harmful and even deadly.&nbsp; This is a needed corrective to the American attitude that the more screening and testing, the healthier we will be.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Marcia Angell, author of <i>The Truth About Drug Companies<br></i><br>&#x201c;Its title, &#x2018;Less Medicine, More Health,&#x2019;&nbsp;sums up his trenchant, point-by-point critique of test-based health care and quality control.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i></p><h2>Learning the Ropes: An Apprentice on the Last of the Windjammers</h2><p>In 1938, Eric Newby signed on as an apprentice on the Finnish four-masted barque <i>Moshulu</i> for a 'round-the-world' voyage transiting between Europe and Australia. It was the toughest imaginable introduction to the sailor's life. Few of the crew spoke English, and he was ordered atop the rigging -- 200 feet above deck -- before he could get out of his best jacket and shoes. More extraordinary still, between his shifts he managed to photograph day-to-day life aboard the antique vessel, and on others like her in various ports of call. Though he did not realize it then, these pictures soon became historic, for with a world war brewing, there would never again be a cavalcade of square riggers such as made the circuit that year. Remarkably, the <i>Moshulu</i> is still afloat and is now a restaurant ship, moored in Philadelphia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Eric Newby is the author of fifteen other adventure classics, including <i>The Last Grain Race</i>, <i>A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush</i>, <i>Love and War in the Apennines</i>, and <i>What the Traveler Saw</i>.

Unique - The first history of the horror film to approach it from a queer perspective.. Written with detail and thoroughness - covers all eras of the horror film and correlates specific types of movie monsters to the historical social conditions which produced them.. Explores how popular culture encodes and demonizes queerness within the generic format of the horror film.</p><p>They are half-human horrors, strange and scary aliens, the seemingly-normal-but-deadly danger that lurks around the corner: Hollywood monsters, or homosexuals? Horror fiction has always portrayed society's greatest fears as monstrous incarnations of "the other," so it should be no surprise that there has always been a clear homoerotic subtext in horror films--from <i>Frankenstein</i> to <i>Interview with the Vampire</i>. Harry M. Benshoff's <i>Monsters in the Closet</i> details how Hollywood monsters have not only been a reflection of homosexuals, but that changes in the horror film have actually mirrored changes in attitudes toward homosexuality in our society. Discussing hundreds of classic (and not so classic) movies, Benshoff provides new insight into horror and science fiction films and into how popular culture presents ideas about homosexuality to a broad audience.Harry M. Benshoff recently received his doctorate from the University of Southern California&#39;s School of Cinema-Television.

"You have the right to be lazy," writes Wasserstein. "You can choose not to respond. You can choose not to move." Readers will find out the importance of Lethargiosis--the process of eliminating energy and drive, the vital first step in becoming a sloth. To help you attain the perfect state of indolent bliss, the book offers a wealth of self-help aids. Readers will find the sloth songbook, sloth breakfast bars (packed with sugar, additives, and a delicious touch of Ambien), sloth documentaries (such as the author's 12-hour epic on Thomas Aquinas), and the sloth network, channel 823, programming guaranteed not to stimulate or challenge in any way. ("It may be difficult to distinguish between this and other channels, but only on channel 823 can you watch me sleeping.") Readers will also learn the top ten lies about Sloth, the ten commandments of Sloth, the SLOTH mantra, even the "too-much ten"--over-achievers such as Marie Curie, Shakespeare, and William the Conqueror. You will discover how to become a sloth in your diet, exercise, work, and even love-life (true love leads to passion, she warns, and passion is the biggest enemy of sloth). <br> Wendy Wasserstein is one of America's great comic writers--one who always has a serious point to her humor. Here, as she pokes fun at the self-help industry, she also satirizes the legion of Americans who are cultural and political sloths.<br></p><p><br>The late <strong>Wendy Wasserstein</strong> was the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright of <em>The Heidi Chronicles</em>, which also won a Tony Award. Her other plays include <em>The Sisters Rosensweig, Uncommon Women and Others, Isn't It Romantic</em>, and <em>An American Daughter</em>.

Wasserstein's rapid-fire comic prose offers the perfect satire on a culture that continually invents more ways of moving less (television remotes, cell phones) in order to be blissfully slothful."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"A delightfully hilarious parody...Wasserstein provides a plethora of amusing motivational strategies.... Not since Wendy Kaminer's <em>I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional</em> has self-help been so enjoyable!"--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"This funny writer has produced 'Sloth: The Seven Deadly Sins,' a poke at the self-help industry in which she also satirizes the legion of Americans who are cultural and political sloths."--<em>Newsday</em><p></p><br>"<em>Sloth</em> is a hoot and nicely satirizes the extent to which so many self-improvement programs bring nothing but unhappiness and self-disgust to so many people."--<em>SpiritualityHealth.com</em><p></p><br>"Funny, wise, and paradoxically invigorating, Wendy Wasserstein has written what we can all hope is the self-help book to end all self-help books. <em>Sloth</em> gives us the energy not just to laugh at the whole industry of diet, exercise, and beauty regimens, but succeeds in getting us also to laugh at ourselves. <em>Sloth</em> is a motivational masterpiece." --Joseph Gordon, Dean of Undergraduate Education, Yale College<p></p><br>"Anyone who's ever wondered if it wasn't time to stop and smell the roses needs to read <em>Sloth</em>, Wendy Wasserstein's wise and witty argument in favor of doing absolutely nothing. Embrace Ms. Wasserstein's philosophy and you will not only stop, you will abandon forever exhausting ideas like smelling anything, roses included.

In Beyond the Dream, Dr. Thomas Hora looks at the human condition with compassion and offers insights that can help anyone to awaken spiritually. Spiritual seekers who come from all faiths or none will find much to ponder in Beyond the Dream. They will also open their minds and hearts to the realization of peace, assurance, gratitude and love, here and now.</p><p>Thomas Hora, whose counseling practice in New York City spanned close to fifty years, was a brilliant psychiatrist, a God-centered spiritual seeker, and a pioneer researcher of consciousness. His work makes a lasting contribution to the fields of psychiatry, religion and metaphysics. Dr. Hora&#39;s compassion for human suffering inspired him to seek beyond conventional medical practices for the healing of illnesses, mental disorders, problems and difficulties. Observing as a psychiatrist that traditional forms of treatment did not always make a patient well, he began to explore spiritually enlightened teachings to uncover what knowledge lay within them which could bring individuals to healing and salvation - in the here and now. He discovered a system of thought and a methodology which was born out of his deep understanding of human nature and out of a devoted search for the truth. Gradually, he transcended the practice of traditional psychiatry as he came to see that the solutions to all problems - physical, emotional, mental, experiential - are found in the realm of the spiritual, in other words, solely in the context of God, which is perfect Love, perfect Intelligence, and perfect Life.</p><h2>Philosophic Classics: Ancient Philosophy</h2><p><b></b> This fascinating anthology of classic philosophical readings provides clear translations of the most important Greek philosophers and some of their Roman followers, key influences on the development of Western civilization. <b></b> This book begins with the fragmentary statements of the Pre-Socratics, moves through the all-embracing systems of Plato and Aristotle, and culminates in the practical advice of the Hellenistic writers. <b></b> For anyone interested in owning a collection of clearly translated philosophical works.</p><p><p> <b>Forrest Baird's</b> revisions of <b><i>Philosophic Classics,</i></b> Prentice Hall's long-standing philosophy series, continue the tradition begun in 1961, to provide generations of students with anthologies of high quality in the history of Western philosophy.

Markets are now spreading worldwide - a spread which is often equated with the hope of democracy spreading along with it. But markets still run on old textbook models that ignore social and environmental costs - leading to a new kind of warfare: global economic warfare. Building a Win-Win World demonstrates how the global economy is unsustainable because of its negative effects on employees, families, communities, and the ecosystem. Henderson shows how win-win strategies can become the norm at every level when people see the true current and future costs of short-sighted, narrow economic policies.</p><p>Hazel Henderson is an independent futurist, syndicated columnist, and consultant on sustainable development in over thirty countries. Her editorial columns are syndicated by InterPress Service world- wide. She has published articles in over 250 journals, magazines, and newspapers including The Harvard Business Review, The New York Times, Newsweek, U.S. News and World Report, The Christian Science Monitor, Mainichi (Japan), El Diario (Venezuela), Australian Financial Review, and World Economic Herald (China). Her books have been translated into German, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Korean, Swedish, and Chinese. The first version of her Country Futures IndicatorsTM (an alternative to gross national product) launched in 1996 as a coventure with the Calvert Group, Inc., as the Calvert-Henderson Quality-of-Life Indicators.INTRODUCTION<br><br> Building a Win-Win World: Life Beyond Global Economic Warfare is an effort to continue deconstruction of the economism/competition/conflict paradigm and construction of new platforms for action. We are all constructing new &#x201c;quality-of-life&#x201d; language together. The dysfunctional economism paradigm still controls the debate, however, and we must never forget it for an instant. The economists are still the &#x201c;thought police,&#x201d; and we are enmeshed every day in the old structures in hundreds of ways. There has been tremendous progress. It is slow-motion good news, but that is what I am out to communicate.<br><br> The war system in human societies is at least six thousand years old, but according to much new archeological and paleoanthropological evidence, humans lived in generally peaceful, small egalitarian groups in prehistory. Most of what we are taught as the history of human civilization chronicles the rise of human ego-centeredness, technological ingenuity, and territoriality (as populations and agriculture spread), and the inevitable rise of competition, conflict, and violence in general. This kind of history of the evolution of human societies is a biased account. The conventional history of conquests, military leaders, and the lives of the powerful has been largely indifferent to the experiences of the great majority of ordinary human beings. The work of broader historians, such as Fernand Braudel (1980, 1984) and Emmanuel Wallerstein (1991), the challenge of feminist historians, and new interpretations of archaeological records have enriched our understanding of our past. This is a vital prelude to changing our view of our potential and our future.<br><br> In the twentieth century, humans have clearly demonstrated the limits of their six-thousand-year experimentation with competition,<br><br> territoriality, expansionism, and military conflict. More scholars are at last studying humanity&#x2019;s ancient war system and the roots of human violence&#x2014;all the bad but important news in our biochemistry, brains, evolution, social conditioning, and hierarchical, patriarchal institutions. Increasing technological virtuosity linked to this war system has brought us to the brink of many annihilation scenarios&#x2014;from nuclear and biological holocausts to slower, more insidious threats like toxic wastes, urban decay, desertification, and climate change. This book, however, will not dwell on this now-dysfunctional system and its post&#x2013;Cold War expressions in civil and ethnic conflicts, as well as violence in city streets, in the media, and in our families. Instead, we will trace the emerging death rattles of this violent, competition/conflict paradigm and its dominance-submission, win-lose games. I will identify the flash points and crises that illustrate the dysfunctionality of the paradigm and force us&#x2014;for our very survival&#x2014;toward new approaches. As we examine these signs of human potential for personal and social learning, we see how breakdowns are often precursors and even necessary for breakthroughs.2<br> THE GOOD NEWS IN THE BAD NEWS<br><br> This book will focus on finding the good news in the bad news: where humans are encountering the endgames of the competition/conflict paradigm, where there are signs of transition and transmutation. The very globalization of the war system, of technology, and of industrialization brought the Cold War to a dead end. Since then, the global warfare paradigm has given ground to global economic warfare, which many economists, politicians, and business leaders have hailed as a victory of capitalism and competitive free markets. Yet this global economic warfare has proved little better than the military warfare it was advertised to replace. By the mid-1990s global economic warfare had already reached crisis points of its own.<br><br> Part I of this book, &#x201c;Pathological Paradigms,&#x201d; examines the nature of recent crises. Chapter 1, &#x201c;Global Economic Warfare versus Sustainable Human Development,&#x201d; zeros in on flash points from global to local levels. Chapter 2, &#x201c;Juggernaut Globalism and the Bankruptcy of Economics,&#x201d; surveys the global economy, financial markets, and the unleashed forces of free trade. Chapter 3, &#x201c;The Technology Trap,&#x201d; examines our love affair with technology and its perverse impacts on our lives and environment. Chapter 4, &#x201c;The Jobless Productivity Trap,&#x201d; looks at how the noxious new brew of free-market technological innovation driven by global economic warfare has led to jobless economic growth and further global commercial exploitation of the planet&#x2019;s peoples and natural resources. Chapter 5, &#x201c;Government by Mediocracy and the Attention Economy,&#x201d; examines the rise of global mass media as a new form of governance now driving our politics and private lives&#x2014;and its birthing of hybrid Attention Economies.3<br><br> Part II, &#x201c;Slow-Motion Good News: Road Maps and Resources for Rebirth,&#x201d; examines our human resources and potentials for rebalancing ourselves and our societies on new paths to more cooperative, equitable forms of ecologically sustainable development. Chapter 6 describes a new force in the world, &#x201c;Grassroots Globalism,&#x201d; as it shows itself in the emerging civil society and the traditionally cooperative, unpaid Love Economies bubbling up to challenge juggernaut globalism and competitive economism rooted in the old war system. Chapter 7, &#x201c;Rethinking Human Development and the Time of Our Lives,&#x201d; refocuses our attention on the importance of the time of our lives&#x2014; our only real asset. Chapter 8, &#x201c;Cultural DNA Codes and Biodiversity: The Real Wealth of Nations,&#x201d; shows that the encoding of our collective experience, as it has coevolved with the biodiversity of all species, is our real source of wealth. Human resourcefulness, choices, and aspiration for personal development can create new societies. Our minds and spirits are powerful beyond our full awareness.<br><br> Part III, &#x201c;Building a Win-Win World: Breakthroughs and Social Innovations,&#x201d; examines how our human potentials are finding expression in new forms of enterprise, institutions, partnerships, and cooperative agreements that can lead to the building of a win-win world. Chapter 9, &#x201c;Information: The World&#x2019;s Real Currency Isn&#x2019;t Scarce,&#x201d; describes how money became mistaken for wealth and was cartelized in the global casino, and how the new, pure information currencies (which have always been the world&#x2019;s real currency) are now emerging at the global and local levels. Chapter 10, &#x201c;Redefining Wealth and Progress: The New Indicators,&#x201d; takes a look behind the statistical veils of economics. It describes how old indicators of economic growth&#x2014; for example, the gross national product (GNP)&#x2014;are being overhauled, and how new indicators of quality of life are slowly replacing economic indicators as new scorecards of human development. Chapter 11, &#x201c;Perfecting Democracy&#x2019;s Tools,&#x201d; describes the importance of the spread of democracies around the world and the urgent need to perfect this still imperfect system of collective decision making and governance, including social and technological innovations waiting in the wings. Chapter 12, &#x201c;New Markets and New Commons: The Cooperative Advantage,&#x201d; compares and contrasts the strategies of cooperation and competition, of markets and rules/agreements, of public, private, and civil sectors, and how they can all be rebalanced to build a win-win future. Chapter 13, &#x201c;Agreeing on Rules and Social Innovations for Our Common Future,&#x201d; reviews efforts during the 1990s to forge new international agreements and institutions to create a social architecture suitable for a truly human twenty-first century.4<br> THE ROLE OF OUR MENTAL TOOL BOXES<br><br> This book, like my earlier ones, is also about the mental tool boxes we carry in our heads: our belief systems, cultural conditioning, assumptions, worldviews, concepts, and habits of thought. On the societal level, I have termed these collective mental tool boxes paradigms&#x2014;extending the scope of the term originally coined by Thomas Kuhn to describe such mental processes in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962). Our mental tool boxes are lenses or spectacles by which we humans view and construct our responses to the world around us.<br><br> Each of us, whether we acknowledge these powerful mental tools or not, shapes our world through the use of such paradigms, which evolve in response to our experience, as I elaborated in Paradigms in Progress (1991, 1995). For me, two of the most useful of these mental tools are (1) my &#x201c;zoom lens,&#x201d; which I use to zero in on something that interests me and to keep going deeper with increasing magnification of the details until I have a more complete picture; and (2) my &#x201c;wide shot,&#x201d; which allows me to pull back and see the phenomenon as successively smaller and smaller pieces of a much larger jigsaw puzzle. All of us have this mental equipment, which can be honed and perfected as a high-quality camera for viewing our world. This can help us see the flow of events and understand the paradigms we and others are using to shape our perceptions.<br><br> Developing mental paradigm-spotting equipment is also a spiritual pursuit. Such mental exercises make us deeply aware of our essence&#x2014;in fact, our souls&#x2014;since when we look at our own mental functioning we see that it emerges from our brains but cannot be placed neatly in some set of neurons. We are brought to the oldest puzzle of our species: Who is the &#x201c;I&#x201d; that is studying and judging all this? Every great religious and spiritual tradition has posed this question&#x2014;through meditation, as in Buddhism and Hinduism; through prayer, as in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism; through contemplation, as in many indigenous traditions; as well as through rituals, ceremonies, holy days, festivals, celebrations, music, dance, and art.5<br><br> Many traditions have sought to explain the marvelous paradoxes of human existence: that we possess this mental equipment and ever-expanding awareness on a shrinking planet, in an unremarkable solar system, somewhere in the arm of an equally undistinguished spiral galaxy. Simultaneously, we inhabit for a brief time a delicate and miraculous physical body, which will decompose into a few dollars worth of chemical elements and disperse again into the earth that gave us birth. This profoundly beautiful mystery evokes our questions, our imagination, and our many images of this great creation and its divinity&#x2014;whether in the grand sweep of the known universe or within ourselves.<br><br> This book is my most recent album of the &#x201c;snapshots&#x201d; I have collected of this great unfolding human drama as I have traveled the world since I wrote Paradigms in Progress. How do we humans face new challenges resulting from the effects of our mental and technological ingenuity? I scan for signs of increasing levels of global awareness, responsibility, and wisdom that must emerge for our survival and development.<br><br> Indeed, I believe we humans are coming up to &#x201c;graduation&#x201d; time on this planet. We must now learn a great deal and grow in moral stature very rapidly. The ubiquitous goal of growth as measured by GNP must soon be redirected. We must grow up! Since I took up my pen to record this process thirty years ago, the global debate has been getting clearer. New paradigms are competing with dysfunctional belief systems and clarifying our situation and our future goals and choices. Since World War II we have been slowly leaving the industrial era behind. I summarized this process in the 1970s in Creating Alternative Futures (1978, 1996) and in the 1980s in The Politics of the Solar Age (1981, 1988).<br><br> Even so, these vast historical change processes are uneven. I view these uneven shifts in the industrialism paradigm in terms similar to those of many of my fellow futurists. I have been a card-carrying futurist for the past quarter century&#x2014;belonging to many of the same professional societies as U.S. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (with whom I now often disagree) and our mutual friends Alvin and Heidi Toffler. Most futurists associate in professional societies. These include the World Futures Studies Federation, a global group with a moving base currently in Australia; the U.S.-based World Future Society, which publishes The Futurist, Futures Research Quarterly, and Future Survey; Futuribles, based in Paris, France; the Futures Library in Salzburg, Austria; the World Association for Social Prospects, in Geneva and Benin, Africa; The African Future Society; the Chinese Futures Society, in Beijing; and many similar associations in Latin and Central America, Japan, Asia, Africa, and Europe.6<br><br> Futurists have almost been an underground in the academic world&#x2014;often vilified by their colleagues in more established, traditional disciplines. Academe had no place for visionary futurist Buckminster Fuller, who became an author and entrepreneur in planetary design and was only fully recognized after his death. In 1995 he would have celebrated his hundredth birthday. Today&#x2019;s universities still operate within the defined disciplinary boundaries and paradigms inherited from the underlying ideologies of the Industrial Revolution and the European Age of Enlightenment. I described these paradigms based on the reductionism engendered by Ren� Descartes and the mechanistic &#x201c;clockwork universe&#x201d; of Isaac Newton in Creating Alternative Futures and The Politics of the Solar Age. Seamless reality was partitioned into separate disciplinary boxes housed in separate buildings on campuses, while fledgling interdisciplinary programs were deemed &#x201c;not rigorous&#x201d; and subject to the first budget cuts. Future studies became established largely outside traditional academia&#x2014;with notable exceptions, including departments at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the University of Houston at Clear Lake City, Texas. The business sector embraced futures research as an integral part of its need to plan, to invest in research and development, and to innovate new products and services. Such corporate futures research includes the Trend Analysis Program of the U.S. insurance industry, the futures scenario building of Shell Oil in Europe, and the longer-term futures studies conducted by Mitsubishi Research Institute in Japan.<br> THE NARROW FRAMEWORK OF ECONOMICS<br><br> Often, the most resistant traditional discipline has been economics&#x2014; for many good reasons. Economics became the primary discipline of industrial development, which became synonymous with economic development, i.e., GNP-measured economic growth and what I term &#x201c;economism.&#x201d; The economism paradigm sees economics as the primary focus of public policy as well as of individual and public choices. Thus economics became the most powerful discipline&#x2014;even outranking physics and mathematics&#x2014;bestriding the policy process since World War II in every country in the world. I researched the genesis of this in depth for my friend Fritjof Capra&#x2019;s The Turning Point (1981) and my own The Politics of the Solar Age. I found independent-minded economists&#x2014;a few in every generation&#x2014;who had questioned the ever-narrowing framework of economics. I saw how its assumptions were concealed in a language of false universalism and specious mathematics as well as a simplistic view of human nature.7<br><br> What I had stumbled on, as had those before me and others who came later, such as my friend Marilyn Waring in If Women Counted (1988), is that economics, far from a science, is simply politics in disguise. No wonder I defined myself as a futurist and was sometimes called an &#x201c;anti-economist&#x201d;&#x2014;which is true. I want to dethrone economics as the predominant policy analysis tool of the global economic warfare system. Our global future is multidisciplinary, cooperative, and rainbow hued. Futures research is still pooh-poohed by economists, academics, and policymakers. The extended space/time horizons of futures research, its scope&#x2014;global and coverin...</p><h2>Herbal Medicines: A Guide for Health Care Profesionals</h2><p>A general disillusionment with conventional medicines, coupled with the desire for a &#34;natural&#34; life style has resulted in an increasing utilization of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) across the developed world.

The Voulet-Chanoine mission left Dakar in 1898 for the Lake Chad region, hoping to establish effective borders between the French and British empires and "pacify" a notoriously belligerent region. The mission soon degenerated into a grisly display of colonial violence, leaving a trail of pillage, murder, and enslavement in its wake. When the story of its outrages reached Paris, there was a public uproar and a second mission was dispatched to investigate. Eventually, on July 14 1899, the two missions clashed in a dramatic shootout, which led Voulet and Chanoine to declare independence from France and to establish an African kingdom under their own rule. But their mad dreams of kingship were cut short when the African soldiers under their command mutinied and killed them both. Was this bloody episode the consequence of two men's madness, or of a far wider set of attitudes?</p><p><br><strong>Bertrand Taithe</strong> is Professor of Cultural History at the University of Manchester.

Beginning with her great-grandfather, who rose from rural poverty to become an influential landowner, and continuing to the present, Mai Elliott traces her family's journey through an era of tumultuous change. She tells us of childhood hours in her grandmother's silk shop, and of hiding while French troops torched her village, watching while blossoms torn by fire from the trees flutter "like hundreds of butterflies" overhead. She makes clear the agonizing choices that split Vietnamese families: her eldest sister left her staunchly anti-communist home to join the Viet Minh, and spent months sleeping in jungle camps with her infant son, fearing air raids by day and tigers by night. And she follows several family members through the last, desperate hours of the fall of Saigon-including one nephew who tried to escape by grabbing the skid of a departing American helicopter. Based on family papers, dozens of interviews, and a wealth of other research, this is not only a memorable family saga but a record of how the Vietnamese themselves have experienced their times.<br></p><p>Most books about Vietnam focus on the French who colonized it or the Americans who sought to "save" it. This combination of memoir and family history shows the Vietnamese "as they saw themselves as the central players in their own history." The author's perspective is particularly enlightening because her relatives, though unquestionably better-educated and better-off than the typical Vietnamese, made a variety of political and social choices over the course of the turbulent century she chronicles. Her great-grandfather was a mandarin and member of the imperial court; her father was a government official under French rule; her older sister married a Communist. Elliott herself enrolled in Georgetown's School of Foreign Service in 1960, married an American, and supported the U.S. crusade in Vietnam until her experiences interviewing Vietcong prisoners of war for a Rand Corporation study convinced her that the corrupt Saigon regime failed to offer a convincing alternative to Communism. Because she had family on both sides, Elliott's portrait of the war is subtler and less didactic than previous accounts by proponents of either ideology. Her prose is a bit formal and dense for the casual reader, but by telling her relatives' personal stories and explicating their culture's traditional values, her reflective narrative makes humanly complicated a history too often oversimplified. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><br><strong>Mai Elliott </strong>was born and raised in Vietnam and attended Georgetown University on a scholarship. She lived in Vietnam again from 1963 to 1968 and worked for the Rand Corporation interviewing Viet Cong prisoners of war.

Emphasizing our corporeal rather than our intellectual engagements with film and other media, <i>Carnal Thoughts </i>shows how our experience always emerges through our senses and how our bodies are not just visible objects but also sense-making, visual subjects. Sobchack draws on both phenomenological philosophy and a broad range of popular sources to explore bodily experience in contemporary, moving-image culture. She examines how, through the conflation of cinema and surgery, we've all "had our eyes done"; why we are "moved" by the movies; and the different ways in which we inhabit photographic, cinematic, and electronic space. <i>Carnal Thoughts </i>provides a lively and engaging challenge to the mind/body split by demonstrating that the process of "making sense" requires an irreducible collaboration between our thoughts and our senses.</p><p>"Powerfully written and movingly personal, <i>Carnal Thoughts</i> consistently demonstrates what an embodied film criticism might actually be. Sobchack is insistent, impassioned, and persuasive in her attempt to show how cinematic spectatorship is always more than visual. The scholarship is superior, the organization is strong, and the literary style is accomplished, engaging, and polished. This is an extremely important work."&#x2015;Patrice Petro, author of <i>Aftershocks of the New</i><br><br>"<i>Carnal Thoughts</i> wonderfully conveys the phenomenolgical aim of Sobchack's work.

The internal processes of ectotherms differ in many respects from the corresponding processes in endotherms, and amphibians and reptiles function differently from birds and mammals in communities and ecosystems. Understanding how and why amphibians and reptiles differ from birds and mammals enriches a biological education, and the study of herpetology is a great deal more than just the study of amphibians and reptiles. </p> <p> In our view, understanding amphibians and reptiles as organisms requires a perspective that integrates their morphology, physiology, behavior, and ecology and places that information in a phylogenetic context. This book does that&#x2014;it presents the biology of amphibians and reptiles as the product of phylogenetic history and environmental influences acting in both ecological and evolutionary time. We emphasize how amphibians and reptiles function in the broadest sense. For example, ectothermal temperature regulation is reflected in nearly every aspect of the biology of amphibians and reptiles, from their body shapes (extremely small body size and elongate body shape are feasible only for ectotherms) to their role in ecosystems (low-energy flow and high-conversion efficiency are the result of ectothermy). </p> <p> We have emphasized the integration of information from different biological specialties to produce a picture of amphibians and reptiles as animals that do remarkable things and play important roles in modern ecosystems. Evolution provides the context in which the distinctive characteristics of amphibians and reptiles must be evaluated, and both ancestral and derived features are central to understanding their biology. Throughout the book we have emphasized the use of phylogenetic information to understand the evolution of ecological, behavioral, and physiological characters. This edition of <i>Herpetology</i> reflects both the rate of new developments in the discipline and the continuing contributions of colleagues who have suggested ways to expand and strengthen our treatment of the biology of amphibians and reptiles. The increasing use of cladistic techniques and the incorporation of more kinds of data in phylogenetic analyses have substantially changed our understanding of the history and content of some groups. Those changes are conspicuous in the chapters covering systematics and in the integration of phylogenetic information with studies of natural history. The addition of color photographs of many species provides a far better impression of the appearance of the animals and enhances the presentation of phenomena such as aposematic coloration and mimicry that lose much of their impact in blackand-white photographs. </p> <p> In response to suggestions from colleagues and students, we have added a chapter on biogeography to illustrate the important contributions that studies of amphibians and reptiles have made to this area and the insights about the ecology and evolution of extant species that only a biogeographic perspective can provide. Splitting the treatment of reproduction and life history into separate chapters&#x2014;devoted to amphibians and to reptiles&#x2014;has allowed us to respond to requests that we increase the amount of information about these important topics, and emphasize the major differences between the groups. And the expanded treatment of conservation in this edition reflects the importance this topic is assuming in many herpetology courses as habitat destruction, pollution, and disease exact an ever-increasing toll on the diversity of amphibians and reptiles. Collaboration by the six authors&#x2014;whose research specializations include autecology, synecology, systematics, evolution, morphology, physiology, and behavior&#x2014;has produced a treatment that interweaves these areas. We find the interrelationships among different levels of biological organization fascinating and have tried to build students' understanding of these relationships from chapter to chapter. In the case of lizards, for example, one or more aspects of the intricate correlations among phylogeny, foraging mode, diet, morphology, exercise physiology, predator avoidance, social system, and reproductive mode is discussed in nearly every chapter. We have used this technique of building topics in the hope that students will find the complex relationships that emerge intellectually stimulating. Above all, this book is the product of the lifelong fascination each of us has felt for the animals we study. We hope we will succeed in conveying this sense of excitement to our readers. </p></p><h2>Literary Language and Its Public in Late Latin Antiquity and in the Middle Ages</h2><p><p>In this, his final book, Erich Auerbach writes, "My purpose is always to write history." Tracing the transformations of classical Latin rhetoric from late antiquity to the modern era, he explores major concerns raised in his <i>Mimesis</i>: the historical and social contexts in which writings were received, and issues of aesthetics, semantics, stylistics, and sociology that anticipate the concerns of the new historicism.</p></p><p><b>Erich Auerbach</b> (1892-1957) was Sterling Professor of Romance Philology at Yale University.

Cavendish is the author of many poems, short stories, biographies, memoirs, letters, philosophical and scientific works (including <i>The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing World,</i> the first work of science fiction by a woman), and nineteen plays.</p><p><i>"The Convent of Pleasure" and Other Plays</i> collects four of Cavendish's dramatic works that are among the most revealing of her attitudes toward marriage and her desire for fame. <i>Loves Adventures</i> (1662) centers on a woman succeeding in war and diplomacy by passing as a man. Similarly, the heroine of <i>Bell in Campo</i> (1662) rescues her husband at the head of an army of women in this tale of a marriage of near equals. <i>The Convent of Pleasure</i> (1668) proposes a separatist community of women and has received attention for its suggestion of lesbian sexuality. <i>The Bridals</i> (1662), a more typical restoration comedy satirizing marriage, rounds out the collection.</p><p>Edited with notes and annotation by Anne Shaver, <i>"The Convent of Pleasure" and Other Plays</i> also contains a timeline, biography and bibliography of the Duchess, an appreciation of Cavendish's life and work, and a bibliography of critical essays. Also included are all of Cavendish's epistles <i>To the Reader</i> as well as <i>Other Preliminary Matter from Playes</i> (1662), and Cavendish's original preface to <i>Plays Never Before Printed</i> (1668).

Has that brought us the promised economic utopia? Just the opposite. For decades, the dominant elite has used the federal government to all but encourage companies to buy one another up, outsource all their production, and make their profits by leveraging their complete power over the market itself.

Which of the four eyeglass stores listed in the directory should you visit first? Don't waste a lot of time deciding; it really doesn't matter. A single, huge international corporation owns three of the four eyeglass stores listed. And the fourth? Out of business. Think you'll try your luck at Sears? Don't bother. The same company you've never heard of controls their eyewear department, too. What appears at first to be a fine example of competitive capitalism in action is, in fact, an immense monopoly in disguise. And it's far from being the only one.<p>In <i>Cornered</i>, journalist Barry C.

Lynn shows how monopolies threaten independent businesses, squelch innovation, degrade the quality and safety of basic products, destabilize our most vital industrial and financial systems, and destroy the very fabric of democracy. Avoiding the partisan cant that has poisoned virtually every important American debate in recent years, he explains how, over the past three decades, leaders of both parties and thinkers across the political spectrum have encouraged and enabled the growth of monopolies. He traces the history of how such now-familiar phrases as "free market" and "consumer welfare" were created and used to pave the way for monopolization. Lynn also demonstrates how the drive for "always lower prices," routinely invoked to justify ruthless practices that might once have landed their perpetrators in jail, makes jobs disappear, puts small businesses out of business, and turns dreams of entrepreneurial success into impossible fantasies.</p><p>Complete with an entirely fresh set of solutions based on the traditional American approach of empowering the individual citizen, <i>Cornered</i> is both a wake-up call and a call to arms for anyone who believes in democracy, competition, and liberty for all.</p><b>Advance Praise for <i>Cornered</i></b><p>"<i>Cornered</i> is a real eye-opener for America's business community.

Salvias, commonly known as sages, grow throughout temperate and subtropical parts of the world, from sea level to altitudes of more than 11,000 feet (3400 meters). They occur in many forms: perennial, biennial, annual herbs, and evergreen or deciduous shrubs. These amazingly varied plants are also noteworthy for their remarkable resistance to pests and diseases, their drought tolerance--and their beautiful flowers. Following the great success of Betsy Clebsch&#39;s first book on salvias comes this expanded edition, The New Book of Salvias: Sages for Every Garden. Betsy has added more than 50 new species and cultivars such as Salvia castanea and S. recurva, bringing the total to approximately 150 beautiful, gardenworthy species and significant hybrids. She documents them alphabetically and includes botanical descriptions, information on habit, blooming cycle, recommended companion plants, and delightful historical tidbits of discovery and usage. Nearly 100 new photos and illustrations make this new edition even more attractive than its predecessor. In her ardent pursuit of salvias, Clebsch has explored the wild to collect plants and seeds to test in her California garden. The resulting wealth of cultural information in The New Book of Salvias ensures that our gardens will not only be exquisitely aromatic but also wonderfully picturesque.</p><p>In this expanded edition of Betsy Clebsch&#39;s first book on salvias, Clebsch has added more than 50 new species and cultivars such as Salvia castanea and S. recurva, bringing the total to approximately 150 beautiful, gardenworthy species and significant hybrids.Betsy Clebsch is a noted amateur botanist and horticulturist in Northern California, having made and tended five gardens in Virginia, Texas, and California.

Packed with never-before-told tales of the American frontier, Gold Dust &amp; Gunsmoke sends you galloping through the tumultuous California territory of the mid-nineteenth century, where disputes were settled with six-shooters and the lines of justice were in perpetual flux. Armed with meticulous research, John Boessenecker has a remarkable knack for finding the perfect details to capture all the color, excitement, and hullabaloo of the Gold Rush. Gold fever drew a diverse group from around the world to California. San Francisco Bay became a virtual parking lot filled with abandoned vessels whose crews had headed for the hills of the new El Dorado. Remnants of the forces fighting in the Mexican War also got in on the action. These forces included transplanted Bowery Boys, the notorious New York City street gang with ties to Tammany Hall. The Sydney Ducks, a large contingent of new arrivals from Australia&#x2019;s penal colony, added a bit of outlaw innovation from down under. With more than enough gold dust to go around early in the Gold Rush, crime was rare, but as the stakes rose and the easily panned gold dwindled, robbery and murder became a part of life on the frontier. Word of the San Miguel massacre rippled from mining camp to mining camp, retelling of the slaying of ten people, an entire family taken down by gunshot and ax. Settlers throughout the frontier followed the exploits of Joaquin Murrieta, the most famous Hispanic outlaw and the most notorious bandit of the Gold Rush. Bandits, highwaymen, and other desperadoes cruised the frontier looking for stakes. The stories of their crimes and their confrontations with justice are recounted here, many for the first time. With virtually no police protection on the frontier, vigilance committees took justice into their own hands. Six penalties were traditionally handed down: hanging, whipping, ear-cropping, head shaving, branding, or banishment. Since few people in this transient society knew each other, vigilantes sought ways of physically marking criminals, cropping their ears or branding their cheek with an "R" for robber, or "H.T." for horse thief. California&#x2019;s population swelled in these heady days, spawning dozens of saloons, gambling halls, fandango houses, and bordellos. The names of the rapidly sprouting mining camps reflected the rough society therein: Drunkard&#x2019;s Bar, Garrote, Hell&#x2019;s Delight, Whorehouse Gulch, Git Up and Git. Amusements paralleled the raucous cult of the masculinity of the West. Bare knuckle prizefighting, cock-fights, bullfights, and the brutal bull and bear fights filled the hours not spent drinking, whoring, and gambling. Published in tandem with the one hundred fiftieth anniversaries of the Gold Rush and California&#x2019;s statehood, these authentic stories of gunfighters, lawmen, vigilantes, and barroom brawlers comprise an important contribution to the rich lore of the American West.<b>JOHN BOESSENECKER</b> is a San Francisco attorney and historian.

It is well organized, starting with some basic thermodynamics background and moving to more complicated thermo. The next section is kinetics, which is also presented not nearly as well as the thermo, but Atkins does a good job nonetheless. Spectroscopy and statistical mechanics come next and although they are not simple to understand, Atkins is concise in his presentation. The remainder of the book is additional material which may or may not be covered in a physical chemistry course. What should also be noted are the appendices at the end. Atkins includes very helpful supplemental material in mathematics which is needed for the thermodynamics discussion. The tables are somewhat lacking, but any good reference book can supplement this information.

George has become the unofficial spokesperson for responsible leadership&#x2014;in business, the media, and academia. <p>In <i>Authentic Leadership</i> Bill George makes the case that we do need new leaders, not just new laws, to bring us out of the current corporate crisis. He persuasively demonstrates that authentic leaders of mission-driven companies will create far greater shareholder value than financially oriented companies. During George's twelve-year leadership at Medtronic, the company's market capitalization soared from $1.1 billion to $460 billion, averaging 35% per year.</p> <p>George candidly recounts many of the toughest challenges he encountered -- from ethical dilemmas and battles with the FDA to his own development as a leader. He shows how to develop the five essential dimensions of authentic leaders&#x2014;purpose, values, heart, relationships, and self-discipline. Authentic Leadership offers inspiring lessons to all who want to lead with heart and with compassion for those they serve.</p> <p>Bill George helps readers answer vital questions such as: What should I do when my personal values conflict with company business values? How do I make trade-offs between the needs of my customers, my employees, and my company's shareholders?

The play begins with the 1990s controversy over color-blind casting for <i>Miss Saigon</i>, before it spins into a comic fantasy, in which the character DHH pens a play in protest and then unwittingly casts a white actor as the Asian lead. <i>Yellow Face</i> also explores the real-life investigation of Hwang&#x2019;s father, the first Asian American to own a federally chartered bank, and the espionage charges against physicist Wen Ho Lee.

A student of Berenson, Schapiro, and Friedlaender, he taught for more than fifty years, influencing generations of Renaissance scholars. At the time of his death he was Paul Goodloe McIntire Professor Emeritus of the History of Art at the University of Virginia. He was a Knight of the Crown of Italy, a Knight Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, an honorary citizen of Florence, and an honorary member of the Academy of the Arts of Design, Florence, a society whose charter members included Michelangelo and the Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Hartt authored, among other works, <i>Florentine Art under Fire</i> (1949); <i>Botticelli</i> (1952); <i>Giulio Romano</i> (1958); <i>Love in Baroque Art</i> (1964); <i>The Chapel of the Cardinal of Portugal</i> (1964); three volumes on the painting, sculpture, and drawings of Michelangelo (1964, 1969, 1971); <i>Donatello, Prophet of Modern Vision</i> (1974); <i>Michelangelo's Three Piet�s</i> (1975); and the monumental <i>Art: A History o f Painting, Sculpture, Architecture,</i> now in its fourth edition (1993). </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b> <i>David G .

He was editor of <i>The Collins Big Book of</i> <i>Art</i> (2005).&nbsp; In 2005 he also received the College Art Association&#x2019;s national award for Distinguished Teaching in Art History.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p> When Frederick Hartt's <i>History o f Italian Renaissance Art</i> was first published, more than thirty years ago, it was an epoch-making achievement. This large volume with its dozens of color plates presented for the reader the story of Italian Renaissance art as it was loved, appreciated, and understood by one of the great scholars of the period. Before his death in 1991, Frederick Hartt was able to revise the book for two later editions. In 1994 a fourth edition offered minor revisions to Hartt's text and illustrations in the light of new discoveries and the restoration of the Sistine Chapel and other works. Now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, this new edition has been undertaken to update and enhance Hartt's original vision. I think he would have been especially pleased with our ability to offer color illustrations throughout the book, uniting the images with the text in a manner not possible before. </p> <p> As I set about updating Hartt's vision, my intent was to maintain the integrity of the story that he had first told so enthusiastically many years ago. The organization of the text as he planned it has been retained, and many of the works illustrated are the same. The new works added here were chosen to expand and enhance Hartt's original vision. </p> <p> The history of Italian Renaissance art is a vast and complex subject that could be told in a number of ways. Frederick Harrt's view was a traditional one that had its roots in the first history of Renaissance art, written by Giorgio Vasari in the sixteenth century. Like Vasari, Hartt emphasized the art that was created in Florence, Rome, Siena, and Venice. While art historians have discovered much that is interesting and important in the art created in Naples, Milan, Ferrara, and other centers during the Renaissance, to include this material in extensive detail would have detracted from Hartt's thesis that Renaissance art evolved in Florence and had its most fulfilling later development in Rome, Siena, and Venice. His belief that each of these cities evolved a unique style was the basis for his organization; as such, chapters were devoted to the developments in each center. Such an approach remains appropriate, for the story of each city's art has an internal integrity that is based on its own independent political and social structure and development. </p> <p> Hartt's model, Vasari's <i>Lives of the Artists,</i> was based on an interest in understanding each artist as a creative individual. While such a biographical and focused approach is still rewarding, it means that each artist is isolated and discussed independently. This organization provides readers with a strong sense of the personality and artistic development of each individual, while at the same time requiring that they re-create the original, overlapping chronology of events and works. </p> <p> While choosing to maintain Harrt's traditional framework, I have at the same time introduced a number of changes. Illustrations have been deleted to make way for other works that enrich our understanding of the diversity of the period. While Hartt emphasized religious art, I have added a number of secular works. Also new is a series of portraits of significant patrons and personalities of the period. Extracts from Renaissance texts have been added to enhance the historical context. The emphasis throughout, however, remains as Hartt envisioned it&#x2014;on the work of art and on the individual creator rather than on the broader social and historical context within which these works were created. </p> <p> One of Harrt's goals was to help the reader see the works of art as he saw them through the use of evocative and poetic language. As an example of his descriptive powers, note how quickly he captured the effect of Parmigianino's <i>Vision of St. Jerome</i> (see fig. 18.54): "In the darkness that veils any possibility of establishing spatial relationships, rays of light flash from the Madonna's head and shoulders like shards of ice." Again and again his words send the reader back for another, closer look at the work of art. </p> <p> My own love for this period was established when I first visited Florence in 1963 in preparation for a position at the University of New Hampshire. Although at the time I thought of myself as a medievalist in training, my job required that I teach a full semester course on Italian Renaissance art. As a result I devoted extra time to Italy and Renaissance art; when I left Florence that summer, I knew that I would be going back. I owe a special debt to all my teachers at the University of Michigan: Ludovico Borgo, Eleanor Collins, Marvin Eisenberg, Ilene Forsyth, Oleg Grabar, Victor Meisel, Clifton Olds, James Snyder, Harold Wethey, and Nathan Whitman. </p> <p> In preparing this edition I want to thank a number of individuals for their assistance, including my family&#x2014;Ann Thomas Wilkins, Rebecca Wilkins, Katherine Wilkins, Chris Colborn, Tyler Jennings&#x2014;and past and present students and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh&#x2014;Bonnie Apgar Bennett, Maria Carolina Carrasco, Jennifer Craven, Roger Crum, Holly Ginchereau, Ann Sutherland Harris, Ray Anne Lockard, Sarah Cameron Loyd, Erin Marr, Stacey Mitchell, Elizabeth Prince, Azar Rejaie, David Rigo, Jane Vadnal, and Jim Wilkinson.

It considers the role of all those involved in these policies: bureaucrats, doctors, nurses, health officials, lawyers, clerics, and also parents, relatives, and the patients themselves. Using a wealth of original archival material, it highlights many of the moral issues involved in a way that is profoundly disquieting. The book concludes by showing the ease with which many of the perpetrators filtered back into German society after 1945.</p><p>Between 1939 and 1945 the Nazis systematically murdered as many as 200,000 mentally ill or physically disabled people whom they stigmatised as &#39;life unworthy of life&#39;.

Do the rapidly evolving and culturally expanding genres of digital literature mean that the narrative mode of discourse&#x2015;novels, films, television series&#x2015;is losing its dominant position in our culture? Is it necessary to define a new aesthetics of cyborg textuality? </p><p>In <i>Cybertext</i>, Espen Aarseth explores the aesthetics and textual dynamics of digital literature and its diverse genres, including hypertext fiction, computer games, computer-generated poetry and prose, and collaborative Internet texts such as MUDs. Instead of insisting on the uniqueness and newness of electronic writing and interactive fiction, however, Aarseth situates these literary forms within the tradition of "ergodic" literature&#x2015;a term borrowed from physics to describe open, dynamic texts such as the <i>I Ching</i> or Apollinaire's calligrams, with which the reader must perform specific actions to generate a literary sequence.</p><p>Constructing a theoretical model that describes how new electronic forms build on this tradition, Aarseth bridges the widely assumed divide between paper texts and electronic texts. He then uses the perspective of ergodic aesthetics to reexamine literary theories of narrative, semiotics, and rhetoric and to explore the implications of applying these theories to materials for which they were not intended.</p></p><p><p>From computer games to hypertext fiction, Aarseth explores the aesthetics and textual dynamics of digital literature</p><p><b>Espen J.

This guide begins with an introduction to the Sanskrit alphabet, followed by a treatment of the accent �&#x20ac;&#x201d; its changes in combination, inflection, and tone. Succeeding chapters discuss declension, conjugation, parts of speech, more.<br></p><p>It was in June, 1875, as I chanced to be for a day or two in Leipzig, that I was unexpectedly invited to prepare the Sanskrit grammar for the Indo-European series projected by Messrs. Breitkopf and Hartel. After some consideration, and consultation with friends, I accepted the task, and have since devoted to it what time could be spared from regular duties, after the satisfaction of engagements earlier formed. If the delay seems a long one, it was nevertheless unavoidable; and I would gladly, in the interest of the work itself, have made it still longer. In every such case, it is necessary to make a compromise between measurably satisfying a present pressing need, and doing the subject fuller justice at the cost of more time; and it seemed as if the call for a Sanskrit grammar on a somewhat different plan from those already in use--excellent as some of these in many respects are--was urgent enough to recommend a speedy completion of the work begun.The late William Dwight Whitney was Professor of Sanskrit at Yale University, Knight of the Prussian Orden Pour le M�rite, Corresponding Member of the Acad�mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres of the Institute of France, etc., and Editor-in-Chief of <i>The Century Dictionary: An Encyclopedic Lexicon of the English Language</i>.</p><h2>The Complete Manual of Typography: A Guide to Setting Perfect Type</h2><p><p> Testimonials<br> "The ultimate typographic tool: a concise, beautiful book that pulls together everything you need to produce great typography."<br> --Frank Romano, RIT School of Print Media</p> <p> "Clear and elegant...There's no better or more useful introduction to the whole craft of typography."<br> --Roger Black, Danilo Black, Inc.</p> <p>"All you've always wanted to know about type and typography but never dared to ask.

It releases the craft knowledge that used to reside almost exclusively in the heads of people working in type shops. The shops are gone, the technologies have changed, but the goal remains the same. This book explains in very practical terms how to use today's computerized tools to achieve that secret of good design: well-set type.</p> <p>Beautifully designed and richly illustrated, <b>The Complete Manual of Typography</b> is an essential reference for anyone who works with type.

Our actions reflect this when we turn to beloved pets for companionship, vacation in spots of natural splendor, or spend hours working in the garden. Yet we are also a technological species and have been since we fashioned tools out of stone. Thus one of this century's central challenges is to embrace our kinship with a more-than-human world&#x2015;"our totemic self"&#x2015;and integrate that kinship with our scientific culture and technological selves.</p><p>This book takes on that challenge and proposes a reenvisioned ecopsychology. Contributors consider such topics as the innate tendency for people to bond with local place; a meaningful nature language; the epidemiological evidence for the health benefits of nature interaction; the theory and practice of ecotherapy; Gaia theory; ecovillages; the neuroscience of perceiving natural beauty; and sacred geography. Taken together, the essays offer a vision for human flourishing and for a more grounded and realistic environmental psychology.</p></p><p>Peter H. Kahn, Jr., is a Professor in the Department of Psychology and School of Environmental and Forest Sciences at the University of Washington, author of <i>Technological Nature </i>(MIT Press), and Editor-in-Chief of the Journal <i>Ecopsychology. </i>He is coauthor (Patricial H. Hasbach) of <i>The Rediscovery of the Wild</i> (MIT Press).<p>The essays contained in <i>Ecopsychology</i> are the benchmark from which all subsequent elaborations of the discipline will proceed. The introduction and the afterword, by Peter Kahn and Paticia Hasbach, neatly summarize ecopsychology's history, achievements, and challenges. The book does not propose regression to romantic, pre-technological view of nature but rather the use of modern empirical science to forge a fusion between our natural love of the earth, its health, and our own&#x2015;physical and spiritual. This is the canonical text of a new and exciting discipline.</p>&#x2015;<b>Jack Turner</b>, author of <i>The Abstract Wild</i><br><br><p>By bringing so many thoughtful and provocative thinkers together, Peter Kahn and Patricia Hasbach have prescribed a 21st century human-nature reunion through which individuals, families, and communities offer and receive the gifts of nature; a future in which, as a species, we no longer feel alone; and a world where life returns.</p>&#x2015;<b>Richard Louv</b>, author of <i>The Nature Principle </i>and <i>Last Child in the Woods</i><br><br><p>This remarkable collection of stunningly important papers remind us of our deep evolutionary, biological and emotional connection to the natural world.

After watching yet another romantic prospect walk away, he decides to be less than honest with the next beautiful woman he meets: "I played the role and hid from my memories, told Dana I was a black man working hard every day, as single as a dollar bill, no kids, no ex-wives, no problems. With every word I dug my hole deeper." Of course, Dana has a few secrets of her own, but her chemistry with Vince convinces her she that can just start over without sharing such details. When this new couple's self-protective lies begin to unravel, they have to decide whether they even like each other--let alone how to overcome their hurt. One night in Vince's apartment, after learning about his divorce, Dana jumps up to dial *69 after someone calls and hangs up. <blockquote> That was the first time she'd done that to me. There was a difference in her. In us. A hardness that comes when trust has thinned. Both of us had flipped, become the other side of a dented coin. Some sort of smile was on her face, but traces of her history were in her eyes. </blockquote> Eric Jerome Dickey's devoted readers won't be disappointed with <i>Liar's Game.</i> As in <i>Cheaters</i> and <i>Milk in My Coffee,</i> his easy, conversational style, his humor, his well-rounded characters, and his sexy plot twists will keep the pages turning.

The approach is organized around the abstractions that C++ supports: abstracts data types, combining types in inheritance. The book also explores idioms that thte core of the C++ language does not support directly, such as virtual constructors, prototype objects, and advanced garbage collection techniques.</p><p><p>This book is designed to help programmers who have already learned C++ develop their programming expertise. To understand how programmers achieve proficiency, we need to understand not only how people learn a new language (such as a programming language), but also how a language is used to solve software problems effectively. Learning Programming Languages </p><p>Not everything you need to know about a product is described in the owner's manual. Before the arrival of our first child, my wife and I were admonished by a friend that no book, and no training, could completely prepare us for the art of parenting. We must of course learn minimal, essential skills. But the interesting, challenging, and rewarding aspects of raising a child go beyond this basic knowledge. For example, no book or "owner's manual" will help you understand why your three-year-old daughter rubs toothpaste in your one-year-old's hair, or why your children hang their socks in the refrigerator. </p><p>The same is true of programming languages. Programming language syntax shapes our thinking to a degree, but what we learn in the "owner's manual" about syntax alone only gets us started. Most of what guides the structure of our programs, and therefore of the systems we build, is the styles and idioms we adopt to express design concepts. </p><p>Style distinguishes excellence from accomplishment. An effective parenting style, or programming style, comes from personal experience or by building on the experience of others. A software engineer who knows how to match a programming language to the needs of an application, writes excellent programs. To achieve this level of expertise, we need to go beyond rules and rote, into convention and style, and ultimately into abstractions of concept and structure. It is in that sense that this book is "advanced." </p><p>The rules, conventions, and concepts of programming drive the structure of the systems we build: They give us a model of how to build systems. A model for problem decomposition and system composition is a paradigm, a pattern for dividing the world into manageable parts. C++ is a multiparadigm language. C programmers use C++ as a better C. Object-oriented advocates do everything polymorphically. In fact, a variety of approaches is usually necessary to express the solution to a software problem efficiently and elegantly. </p><p>Learning a programming language is much like learning a natural language. Knowledge of basic syntax lets a programmer write simple procedures and build them into nontrivial programs, just as someone with a vocabulary of a few hundred German words can write a story far richer than see-Dick-run. But mastery of language is quite another issue. That such stories are nontrivial does not make them elegant or demonstrate fluency. Learning language syntax and basic semantics is like taking a 13-hour course in German: It prepares you for the task of ordering a bratwurst, but not for going to Germany to make a living, and certainly not for getting a job as a German language journalist or poet. The difference is in learning the idioms of the language. For example, there is nothing in C itself that establishes</p><p>while (*cp1++ = *cp2++); </p><p>as a fundamental building block, but a programmer unfamiliar with this construct would not be perceived as a fluent C programmer. </p><p>In programming, as in natural language, important idioms underly the suitability and expressiveness of linguistic constructs even in everyday situations. Good idioms make the application programmer's job easier, just as idioms in any language enrich communication. Programming idioms are reusable "expressions" of programming semantics, in the same sense that classes are reusable units of design and code. Simple idioms (like the while loop above) are notational conveniences, but seldom are central to program design. This book focuses on idioms that influence how the language is used in the overall structure and implementation of a design. Such idioms take insight and time to refine, more so than the simple notational idioms. The idioms usually involve some intricacy and complexity, details that can be written once and stashed away. Once established, programming language idioms can be used with convenience and power. The Book's Approach </p><p>Assuming a background in the basic syntax of C++, this book imparts the proficiency that expert C++ programmers gain through experience by giving a feel for the styles and idioms of the language. It shows how different styles let C++ be used for simple data abstraction, full-fledged abstract data type implementation, and various styles of object-oriented programming. It also explores idioms that the core of the C++ language does not directly support, such as functional and frame-based programming, and advanced garbage collection techniques. The Book's Structure </p><p>Rather than taking a "flat" approach to learning the advanced features of C++ by organizing around language features, this book looks at these increasingly powerful abstractions from the perspective of the C++ features required to support them. Each chapter of this book is organized around a family of such idioms. The idioms progressively build on each other in successive chapters. </p><p>Chapter 1 provides a historical perspective on C++ idioms. It provides some motivation as to why idioms came about, and varying degrees to which different idioms can be thought of as part of the language or as outside the language. </p><p>Chapter 2 introduces the fundamental C++ language building blocks: classes and member functions. Though much of the material is basic, the chapter establishes idioms and vocabulary that recur in later chapters. It introduces compiler type systems, and their relationship to user-defined types and classes, from a design perspective. It also presents idioms that make const more useful. </p><p>Chapter 3 introduces idioms that make classes "complete" types. C++ has been evolving to automate more and more of the work of copying and initializing objects, but programmers still need to customize assignment and default constructors for most nontrivial classes. This chapter provides a framework for that customization. I call the idioms described in this chapter canonical forms, meaning that they define principles and standards to make the underlying mechanics of objects work. In addition to the most commonly used canonical form, idioms are presented to apply reference counting to new and existing classes. These are the first idioms of the book to go beyond straightforward application of the base C++ syntax. A variation on reference counting, counted pointers, is shown as a way to move C++ a step further away from the machine, abandoning pointers in deference to smarter, pointer-like objects. Lastly, the chapter looks at how to separate the creation of an object from its initialization. To someone familiar with basic C++, this might seem an unnatural idiom: C++ tightly couples these two operations. The need to separate them arises in the design of device drivers and in systems with mutually dependent resources. </p><p>Chapter 4 introduces inheritance; Chapter 5 adds polymorphism to inheritance to introduce object-oriented programming. Many new C++ programmers get "inheritance fever," using it at every occasion. While it is true that inheritance is used mostly to support the object paradigm, it has a distinctly separate application for software reuse. Introducing inheritance apart from polymorphism helps the reader separate the two concepts and avoids the confusion that often arises from trying to internalize two foreign concepts at once. </p><p>Chapter 6 approaches the constructs, styles and idioms of C++ from the perspectives of architecture and design. It examines what classes mean at the level of an application, high above the level of syntax. Appreciating the relationships between the design abstractions of an application, and between the classes and objects of its implementation, leads to systems that are robust and easily evolved. Another key to evolution is broadening designs beyond a specific application, to cover applications for a whole domain; guiding principles for domain analysis are an important part of this chapter. The chapter contains numerous rules of thumb about appropriate use of inheritance, an area of difficulty for inexpert C++ programmers. Readers who have been exposed to object-oriented design will appreciate the explanation in this chapter of how to transform the output of design to C++ code. Encapsulation as an alternative to inheritance, both for reuse and for polymorphism, is explored in the context of the C++ language. </p><p>Chapter 7 explores reuse of code and designs. Four distinct code mechanisms are explored, with particular attention devoted to the benefits and pitfalls of "inheritance fever." Idioms are presented to significantly reduce the code volume generated by parameterized type libraries using templates. </p><p>The remainder of the book stretches beyond native C++ into advanced programming idioms. Chapter 8 introduces exemplars, objects that take over many of the roles of C++ classes. Exemplars are presented as special objects that solve some common development problems, such as the "virtual constructor" problem. But exemplars also lay the groundwork for more powerful design techniques supporting class independence and independent development. </p><p>Chapter 9, which focuses on symbolic language styles, breaks with concepts many hold fundamental to C++ programming including strong typing and explicit memory management. The idioms of this chapter are certainly outside mainstream C++ development and are reminiscent of styles found in Smalltalk and Lisp. One might claim that those who want to program in Smalltalk should program in Smalltalk. Those who want Smalltalk in all of its glory should indeed use Smalltalk. However, the fact that the styles presented in this chapter are exotic does not mean that the need for them is rare or esoteric. Sometimes we want a small portion of a system to have the flexibility and polymorphism of symbolic languages, and in those situations we need to step outside the bounds of the C++ philosophy while working in the confines of the C++ semantics and type system. This chapter regularizes such idioms so they do not have to be created from scratch each time they are needed. </p><p>Chapter 9 also presents idioms supporting incremental run-time update. Implementations of this idiom are necessarily dependent on many details of the target platform. The gist of this material is to familiarize the reader with the level of technology at which incremental loading issues must be worked. The example presented is typical and, as such techniques go, it is neither obtuse nor trivial. The code presented for incremental loading needs major reworking for platforms other than Sun work stations, and it may be found altogether unsuitable to some environments. None of the book's other idioms depend on this idiom, so it can be pursued or rejected on its own merits. The goal of Chapter 9 is not to change C++ into Smalltalk; this cannot, and should not, be done. These idioms are less compile-time type safe and generally less efficient than "native C++" code; what they offer is flexibility and an increased measure of automated memory management. </p><p>Chapter 10 covers dynamic multiple inheritance. Multiple inheritance is a controversial C++ feature, and discussion of this dynamic variation is separated out to avoid tainting other chapters. While static multiple inheritance as described in Chapter 5 has value, dynamic multiple inheritance avoids problems of a combinatorial explosion of class combinations. This approach has been found valuable in many real-life programs including editors, CAD systems, and database managers. </p><p>The last chapter discusses objects from a high-level, system view. The chapter raises the level of abstraction above chunks the size of a C++ class, to larger and more encompassing units of software architecture, organization, and administration. The chapter puts a number of important system issues in perspective, including scheduling, exception handling, and distributed processing. Some guidelines for modularization and reuse are also discussed, tying together the concepts of Chapters 6 and 7. Included in this discussion are considerations for library structure and maintenance. </p><p>In Appendix A, the basic C++ concepts are compared with their C analogues. Many readers will have already learned these basics or can find them in introductory texts. This material is included here for two reasons. First, it serves as a ready reference for those occasions when you need clarification of an obscure construct without having to go to a separate text. Second, C and C++ styles are viewed from a design perspective, showing how to mix procedural and object-oriented code. This is particularly important for C++ programmers working with a base of C code. </p><p>The examples in this book are based on Release 3.0 of C++, and have been tried under Release 3 of the AT&amp;T USL Language System on many different hardware platforms, and under some other C++ environments as well. Many of the examples have been tried under GNU C++ Version 1.39.0 and Zortech C++ 2.0, though examples using features of the 3.0 release await forthcoming releases of these tools. Some code makes use of general purpose class libraries for maps, sets, lists, and others. Efficient versions of such libraries are available from many vendors, and adequately functional versions can be created from scratch for pedagogical purposes. The skeletons, and sometimes complete bodies, of many general-purpose classes can be gleaned from examples in the book. Key class names are listed in the Index.

In <i>The Realm of Rights</i> Judith Thomson provides a full-scale, systematic theory of human and social rights, bringing out what in general makes an attribution of a right true.</p><p>Thomson says that the question what it is to have a right precedes the question which rights we have, and she therefore begins by asking why our having rights is a morally significant fact about us. She argues that a person&#x2019;s having a right is reducible to a complex moral constraint: central to that constraint is that, other things being equal, the right ought to be accorded. Thomson asks what those other things are that may or may not be equal, and describes the tradeoffs that relieve us of the requirement to accord a right.</p><p>Our rights fall into two classes, those we have by virtue of being human beings and those we have by virtue of private interactions and law. Thomson argues that the first class includes rights that others not kill or harm us, but does not include rights that others meet our needs. The second class includes rights that issue from promises and consent, and Thomson shows how they are generated; she also argues that property rights issue only from a legitimate legal system, so that the second class includes them as well.</p><p><i>The Realm of Rights</i> will take its place as a major effort to provide a stable foundation for our deeply held belief that we are not mere cogs in a communal machine, but are instead individuals whose private interests are entitled to respect.</p></p><p>Judith Jarvis Thomson is Professor of Philosophy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&#x201c;Thomson offers a painstaking analysis of rights... [She] then works from...the right to bodily integrity...to establish the contours of rights to liberty, rights arising out of promises, and more general property rights... This is a wonderful, deep, and engaging book. It surely deserves to become, as it surely will become, the origin of much more important discussion of ideas about rights.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mark Tushnet</b><b>, </b><b><i>Review of Politics</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This book isn&#x2019;t only about rights; it is also about thinking about rights. Thomson works her way through to a comprehensive account of what our rights are (and aren&#x2019;t: she is wonderfully resistant to rights extravaganzas). She also shows us, with elegance and wit, how to do this sort of work: what a philosophical argument is, how one shapes an argument and makes it stick, and why the enterprise is so engaging.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Walzer, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton</b><br><br>&#x201c;A great book. It offers a sustained account of rights and will be the standard work on rights. Thomson&#x2019;s book is more straightforward and much less speculative than, for example, Rawls or Dworkin. Thomson has a very distinctive, attractive voice. The text has a real personality. This is where future work on rights must start.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gilbert Harman, Princeton University</b><br><br>&#x201c;What I like most about this work is Thomson&#x2019;s faithfulness to nuance and detail in aid of clarifying what can accurately be said about her cases at the most general level. In this connection, her discussions of the relation between compensation and the residue of rights, the question of the &#x2018;absoluteness&#x2019; of rights, and alleged moral dilemmas are especially good examples of how she cuts through the many confusions that have surrounded these topics by razor-sharp treatment of cases.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Stephen L. Darwall, University of Michigan</b><br><br>&#x201c;The book presents and defends a systematic normative ethical theory built on the structure of a rights theory. Thomson is at home in these subjects, and her discussion here is masterful.

At the heart of these debates on African identity are the seminal works of politicians, creative writers and philosophers from Africa and its diaspora. In this book, Appiah draws on his experiences as a Ghanaian in the New World to explore the writings of these African and African-American thinkers and to contribute his own vision of the possibilities and pitfalls of an African identity in the late twentieth century. Appiah sets out to dismantle the specious oppositions between &#34;us&#34; and &#34;them,&#34; the West and the Rest, that have governed so much of the cultural debate about Africa in the modern world. All of us, he maintains, wherever we live on the planet, must explore together the relations between our local cultures and an increasingly global civilization. Combining philosophical analysis with more personal reflections, Appiah addresses the major issues in the philosophy of culture through an exploration of the contemporary African predicament.</p><p><br><strong>Kwame Anthony Appiah</strong> is Professor of Afro-American Studies at Harvard University.

He is currently editing the <em>Oxford Book of African Literature</em>.<br><br>"A wonderfully crafted collection of essays."--<em>In My Father's House</em><p></p><br>"Appiah's book on the place of Africa in contemporary philosophy powerfully exposes the dangers of any simplistic notion of African identity in the contemporary world....Tellingly, his reflections upon the calling of philosophy and the relation between post-traditional and not-yet-modern African culture(s) offer a welcome perspective on the increasingly shrill debates over "multiculturalism" that rend the academy. The epilogue on his father's funeral alone more than justifies the whole book."--Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, <em>Common Knowledge</em><p></p><br>"Interesting and thought-provoking."--Safro Kwame, <em>Lincoln University</em><p></p><br>"Montaigne invented the modern essay;...Appiah has the brilliance to extend it."--<em>The Village Voice</em><p></p><br>"A groundbreaking--as well as ground-clearing--analysis of absurdities and damaging presuppositions that have clouded our discussions of race, Africa and nationalism since the 19th century....Mr. Appiah delivers what may very well be one of the handful of theoretical works on race that will help preserve our humanity and guide us gracefully into the next century."--Charles Johnson, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Appiah's essays are exquisitely and painstakingly argued."--<em>Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"An exceptional work, whose contextual sweep and lucidity provide a refreshing intellectual tone away from yahoo populism. In many profound ways, Kwame Appiah's <em>In My Father's House</em> ushers in a new level of discourse on race and culture, placing it within a universal narrative--and where else should it belong?...Without question, a first of its kind."--Wole Soyinka, from <em>Race and the Rout of Reason</em><p></p><br>"<em>In My Father's House</em> is a remarkable book that brings previously invisible cultural assumptions to the surface and obliges us to rethink our conceptions about African identity. Drawing upon a variety of elegantly analyzed historical examples and relating them to his own personal experiences of the African world, Anthony Appiah convincingly demonstrates the need to go beyond stereotyped notions of race and futile laments about past injustices. His observations about authenticity movements, the persistence of Western constructions of African realities, and the emergence of new syntheses of knowledge among African peoples represent a major breakthrough in the ongoing debate over the future of African culture."--Richard Bjornson, <em>Ohio State University</em><p></p><br>"This is an absorbing and path-breaking book by a gifted philosopher. Appiah rescues the philosophy of culture from Herder by insisting that we drop notions like 'authentic negritude' and that 'African culture' is the name of an important project rather than of an available datum. The book's range of reference and the vigor of its argumentation are equally impressive."--Richard Rorty, <em>University of Virginia</em><p></p><br>"Appiah's concern is, he modestly states, 'with the situation of African intellectuals.' In the growing literature on the subject, nobody has defined that situation, as it exists now, more sharply; nobody has built so many bridges to a discourse that might be shared universally. Learned yet unpretentious, serious and witty, critical and kind--this book is bound to infuse debates among African intellectuals with new vigor and to engage philosophers, literary critics, anthropologists and others everywhere. One also wishes it would be read by politicians for its lucid analyses of racism as well as its demonstration of intellectual independence tempered by colonial and post-colonial experience."--Johannes Fabian, <em>University of Amsterdam</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Criminal Law: Cases and Materials [Connected Casebook] (Aspen Casebook Series)</h2><p><p>Buy a <strong>new version</strong> of this Connected Casebook and receive <strong>ACCESS</strong> to the <strong>online e-book</strong>, <strong>practice questions </strong>from your favorite study aids, and an <strong>outline tool</strong> on CasebookConnect, the all in one learning solution for law school students.

Ligamentous articular strain is the name given by William G. Sutherland, D.O., the founder of cranial osteopathy, to a group of techniques that he used for treating the body outside the core axis of the craniosacral system. The term has since come to refer to a wide variety of techniques that engage the body's own healing mechanisms in a relatively direct manner. <p>For over thirty years the Dallas Osteopathic Study Group, originally under the tutelage of Rollin Becker, D.O., has been exploring this type of manipulation. Ligamentous Articular Strain is the distillation of their work. The introductory chapters address the historical development of this approach, and review some of its scientific underpinnings. The remaining chapters are devoted to an examination of the body, area by area, from the feet to the shoulders, describing and depicting effective manipulative techniques. </p><p>Ligamentous Articular Strain provides clear instructions and vivid illustrations which will enable the trained practitioner to quickly gain proficiency in these techniques. It also presents a cogent approach to working with the concepts of the key lesion and the bowstring, first developed by Rollin Becker.</p></p><p>Conrad A. Speece, D.O., is a graduate of the Kansas City College of Osteopathic Medicine, and is board certified in Family Practice. He has lectured on ligamentous articular strain techniques and other aspects of osteopathy throughout the United States and Europe. In addition to his private practice, where he helps train students and residents from the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, he serves as Chairman of the Dallas Osteopathic Study Group, an organization dedicated to refining and expanding the osteopathic approach to treating the human body. Dr. Speece is also an inventor who, among other things, developed and patented the BackMaster� Lumbar and Thoracic OMT Devices. <p>William Thomas Crow, D.O., is a graduate of the University of North Texas Health Science Center-Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, and is certified by the American Osteopathic Board of Special Proficiency in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine.

Hirsch shows that the legal framework for the national urban renewal effort was forged in the heat generated by the racial struggles waged on Chicago's South Side. His chronicle of the strategies used by ethnic, political, and business interests in reaction to the great migration of southern blacks in the 1940s describes how the violent reaction of an emergent "white" population combined with public policy to segregate the city.<br> <br> "In this excellent, intricate, and meticulously researched study, Hirsch exposes the social engineering of the post-war ghetto."&#x2014;Roma Barnes, <i>Journal of American Studies</i><br> <br> "According to Arnold Hirsch, Chicago's postwar housing projects were a colossal exercise in moral deception. . . .

The myth of the heroic soldier testing his individual courage stands in stark contrast to the reality of mass, anonymous death and the suppression of individual actions. <em>Murder in Our Midst</em> shows that this fundamental tension reached its natural conclusion in the Holocaust, and that disguising it has required an ongoing effort to misrepresent war and the Holocaust as something other than industrial killing.<br><br> Examining a broad range of the representations of war's horrors, from scholarly depictions to those in popular literature, poetry, art, and the movies, Omer Bartov finds they have some things in common. Societies and cultures have attempted to form coherent images of horrific events, to draw didactic lessons from them, and to exploit them to legitimate ideological or political positions.<br><br> Made up of interconnected essays, this book is both a scholarly and an often personal and passionate examination of the emergence, implementation, and representation of industrial killing. Bartov draws out the links between recent revisionist attempts to minimize and deny the Holocaust, and Hollywood's ongoing fascination with National Socialism and Hitler's "Final Solution." Arguing that the modern predicament reflects the effects of the Nazi genocide on current perceptions of war, history, and memory, this book is a plea for compassion and commitment in an increasingly violent and indifferent world.<br></p><p>Murder in Our Midst: The Holocaust, Industrial Killing, and Representation examines the emergence, implementation, and representation of industrial killing, an inherent and crucial component of modernity whose most extreme manifestation was the Holocaust. The mechanized, impersonal, and sustained mass destruction of human beings, organized and legitimized by states, scientists, jurists, and intellectuals, is rooted in the industrial slaughterhouse of the Great War. In Murder in Our Midst, Omer Bartov argues that the Nazi death factories are best understood in the context of modern warfare, beginning with the First World War. He shows how the way we understand ourselves reflects the ambivalent effects of the Holocaust on our perceptions of war and violence, history and memory, progress and barbarism. Analyzing a wide array of historical texts, works of fiction, films, and museums, Bartov leads the reader from ancient myths of heroism to the trenches of the Western Front, from Thomas Mann&#39;s romantic vision of war to Primo Levi&#39;s stark depictions of genocide, from colonial war museums to the visual art of the Holocaust. These representations of killing share some of the same important features. They attempt to form coherent images from horrific events, to draw didactic lessons from them, and to use them for political ends.Omer Bartov is at Rutgers University.</p><h2>Marine Fisheries Ecology</h2><p><p>This topical and exciting textbook describes fisheries exploitation, biology, conservation and management, and reflects many recent and important changes in fisheries science. These include growing concerns about the environmental impacts of fisheries, the role of ecological interactions in determining population dynamics, and the incorporation of uncertainty and precautionary principles into management advice. The book draws upon examples from tropical, temperate and polar environments, and provides readers with a broad understanding of the biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries ecology and the interplay between them. As well as covering 'classical' fisheries science, the book focuses on contemporary issues such as industrial fishing, poverty and conflict in fishing communities, marine reserves, the effects of fishing on coral reefs and by-catches of mammals, seabirds and reptiles.

It brings the concerns of social science to an analysis of travel and sightseeing in the postindustrial age, during which the middle class acquired leisure time for international travel.

Lippard and a new afterword by the author.</p><p>&#34;Nothing short of brilliant.&#34; (Lewis Coser)<b>Dean MacCannell</b> is Professor and Chair of Landscape Architecture at the University of California, Davis, and the author of <i>Empty Meeting Grounds</i> (1992) and <i>The Time of the Sign</i> (1982).</p><h2>The Book of 1000 Poems : Classic Collection for Children</h2><p>The Book of 1000 Poems is one of the most popular children&#39;s poetry anthologies ever published.

But when his sworn enemy publicly states that Barney is a wife abuser, an intellectual fraud and probably a murderer, he is driven to write his own memoirs. Charged with comic energy and a wicked disregard for any pieties whatsoever, <b>Barney's Version</b> is a brilliant portrait of a man whom Mordecai Richler has made uniquely memorable for all time. It is also an unforgettable love story, a story about family and the riches of friendship.</p><p>Mordecai Richler is the author of ten successful novels-including <i>Barney's Version</i> (1997), <i>Solomon Gursky Was Here</i> (1989), <i>Cocksure</i> (1968) and <i>The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz</i> (1959)-as well as numerous screenplays, essays, children's books and several works of non-fiction. His most recent book is <i>On Snooker </i>(July 28th, 2001). He is the recipient of dozens of literary awards, among them two Governor General's Awards, The Giller Prize and The Commonwealth Writers Prize. He was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2001, only several months before his death on July 3rd, 2001.<b>Clara<br>1950&#x2013;1952<br>&nbsp;<br>1<br></b>Terry&#x2019;s the spur. The splinter under my fingernail. To come clean, I&#x2019;m starting on this shambles that is the true story of my wasted life (violating a solemn pledge, scribbling a first book at my advanced age), as a riposte to the scurrilous charges Terry McIver has made in his forthcoming autobiography: about me, my three wives, a.k.a. Barney Panofsky&#x2019;s troika, the nature of my friendship with Boogie, and, of course, the scandal I will carry to my grave like a humpback. Terry&#x2019;s sound of two hands clapping, <i>Of Time and Fevers</i>, will shortly be launched by The Group (sorry, the group), a government-subsidized small press, rooted in Toronto, that also publishes a monthly journal, <i>the good earth</i>, printed on recycled paper, you bet your life.<br>&nbsp;<br>Terry McIver and I, both Montrealers born and bred, were in Paris together in the early fifties. Poor Terry was no more than tolerated by my bunch, a pride of impecunious, horny young writers awash in rejection slips, yet ostensibly confident that everything was possible &#x2014; fame, adoring bimbos, and fortune lying in wait around the corner, just like that legendary Wrigley&#x2019;s shill of my boyhood. The shill, according to report, would surprise you on the street to reward you with a crisp new dollar bill, provided you had a Wrigley&#x2019;s chewing-gum wrapper in your pocket. Mr. Wrigley&#x2019;s big giver never caught up with me. But fame did find several of my bunch: the driven Leo Bishinsky; Cedric Richardson, albeit under another name; and, of course, Clara. Clara, who now enjoys posthumous fame as a feminist icon, beaten on the anvil of male-chauvinist insentience. My anvil, so they say.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was an anomaly. No, an anomie. A natural-born entrepreneur. I hadn&#x2019;t won awards at McGill, like Terry, or been to Harvard or Columbia, like some of the others. I had barely squeezed through high school, having invested more time at the tables of the Mount Royal Billiards Academy than in classes, playing snooker with Duddy Kravitz. Couldn&#x2019;t write. Didn&#x2019;t paint. Had no artistic pretensions whatsoever, unless you count my fantasy of becoming a music-hall song-and-dance man, tipping my straw boater to the good folks in the balcony as I fluttered off stage in my taps, yielding to Peaches, Ann Corio,1 Lili St. Cyr, or some other exotic dancer, who would bring her act to a drum-throbbing climax with a thrilling flash of bare tit, in days long before lap-dancers had become the norm in Montreal.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was a voracious reader, but you would be mistaken if you took that as evidence of my quality. Or sensibility. At bottom, I am obliged to acknowledge, with a nod to Clara, the baseness of my soul. My ugly competitive nature. What got me started was not Tolstoy&#x2019;s <i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</i>, or Conrad&#x2019;s <i>The Secret Agent</i>, but the old <i>Liberty </i>magazine, which prefaced each of its articles with a headnote saying how long it would take to read it: say, five minutes and thirty-five seconds. Setting my Mickey Mouse wristwatch on our kitchen table with the checkered oilcloth, I would zip through the piece in question in, say, four minutes and three seconds, and consider myself an intellectual. From <i>Liberty</i>, I graduated to a paperback John Marquand &#x201c;Mr. Moto&#x201d; novel, selling for twenty-five cents at the time in Jack and Moe&#x2019;s Barbershop, corner of Park Avenue and Laurier in the heart of Montreal&#x2019;s old working-class Jewish quarter, where I was raised. A neighbourhood that had elected the only Communist (Fred Rose) ever to serve as a member of Parliament, produced a couple of decent club fighters&nbsp; (Louis Alter, Maxie Berger), the obligatory number of doctors and dentists, a celebrated gambler&#x2013;cum&#x2013;casino owner, more cutthroat lawyers than needed, sundry school teachers and <i>shmata</i>millionaires, a few rabbis, and at least one suspected murderer.<br>&nbsp;<br>Me.<br>&nbsp;<br>I remember snow banks five feet high, winding outside staircases that had to be shovelled in the sub-zero cold, and, in days long before snow tires, the rattle of passing cars and trucks, their wheels encased in chains. Sheets frozen rock-hard on backyard clotheslines. In my bedroom, where the radiator sizzled and knocked through the night, I eventually stumbled on Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Joyce, Gertie and Alice, as well as our own Morley Callaghan. I came of age envying their expatriate adventures and, as a consequence, made a serious decision in 1950.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ah, 1950. That was the last year Bill Durnan, five times winner of the V�zina Trophy, best goalie in the National Hockey League, would mind the nets for my beloved Montreal Canadiens. In 1950, <i>nos glorieux </i>could already deploy a formidable defence corps, its mainstay young Doug Harvey. The Punch Line was then only two thirds intact: in the absence of Hector &#x201c;Toe&#x201d; Blake, who retired in 1948, Maurice &#x201c;The Rocket&#x201d;&nbsp; Richard and Elmer Lach were skating on a line with Floyd &#x201c;Busher&#x201d; Curry. They finished second to bloody Detroit in the regular season and, to their everlasting shame, went down four games to one to the New York Rangers in the Stanley Cup semifinals. At least The Rocket enjoyed a decent year, finishing the regular season second in the individual scoring race with forty-three goals and twenty-two assists.2<br>&nbsp;<br>Anyway, in 1950, at the age of twenty-two, I left the chorus girl I was living with in a basement flat on Tupper Street. I withdrew my modest stash from the City and District Savings Bank, money I had earned as a waiter at the old Normandy Roof (a job arranged by my father, Detective-Inspector Izzy Panofsky), and booked passage to Europe on the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>,3 sailing out of New York. In my innocence, I was determined to seek out and be enriched by the friendship of what I then thought of as the pure of heart, artists, &#x201c;the unacknowledged legislators of the world.&#x201d; And those, those were the days when you could smooch with college girls with impunity. One, Two, Cha-Cha-Cha. &#x201c;If I Knew You Were Coming I&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve Baked a Cake.&#x201d; Moonlit nights on deck, nice girls wore crinolines, cinch belts, ankle bracelets, and two-tone saddle shoes, and you could count on them not to sue you for sexual harassment forty years later, their suppressed memories of date-rape retrieved by lady psychoanalysts who shaved.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not fame, but fortune eventually found me. That fortune, such as it is, had humble roots. To begin with, I was sponsored by a survivor of Auschwitz, Yossel Pinsky, who changed dollars for us at black-market rates in a curtained booth in a photography shop on the rue des Rosiers. One evening Yossel sat down at my table in The Old Navy, ordered a <i>caf� filtre</i>, dropped seven sugar cubes into his cup, and said, &#x201c;I need somebody with a valid Canadian passport.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;To do what?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Make money. What else is left?&#x201d; he asked, taking out a Swiss Army knife and beginning to clean his remaining fingernails. &#x201c;But we should get to know each other a little better first. Have you eaten yet?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So let&#x2019;s go for dinner. Hey, I won&#x2019;t bite. Come, <i>boychick</i>.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And that&#x2019;s how, only a year later, Yossel serving as my guide, I became an exporter of French cheeses to an increasingly flush postwar Canada. Back home, Yossel arranged for me to run an agency for Vespas, those Italian motorized scooters that were once such a hot item. Over the years I also dealt profitably, with Yossel as my partner, in olive oil, just like the young Meyer Lansky; bolts of cloth spun on the islands of Lewis and Harris; scrap metal, bought and sold without my ever having seen any of it; antiquated dc-3s, some of them still being flown North of Sixty; and, after Yossel had moved to Israel, one step ahead of the gendarmes, ancient Egyptian artifacts, stolen from minor tombs in the Valley of the Kings. But I have my principles. I have never handled arms, drugs, or health foods.<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally I became a sinner. In the late sixties, I began to produce Canadian-financed films that were never exhibited anywhere for more than an embarrassing week, but which eventually earned me, and on occasion my backers, hundreds of thousands of dollars through a tax loophole since closed. Then I started to churn out Canadian-content tv series sufficiently shlocky to be syndicated in the U.S. and, in the case of our boffo <i>McIver of the RCMP </i>series, which is big on bonking scenes in canoes and igloos, in the U.K., and other countries as well.<br>&nbsp;<br>When it was required of me, I could rumba as a latter-day patriot, sheltering in the Great Cham&#x2019;s last refuge of the scoundrel. Whenever a government minister, a free-marketeer responding to American pressure, threatened to dump the law that insisted on (and bankrolled to a yummy degree) so much Canadian-manufactured pollution on our airwaves, I did a quick change in the hypocrite&#x2019;s phone booth, slipping into my Captain Canada mode, and appeared before the committee. &#x201c;We are defining Canada to Canadians,&#x201d; I told them. &#x201c;We are this country&#x2019;s memory, its soul, its hypostasis, the last defence against our being overwhelmed by the egregious cultural imperialists to the south of us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I digress.<br>&nbsp;<br>Back in our expatriate days, we roistering provincials, slap-happy to be in Paris, drunk on the beauty of our surroundings, were fearful of retiring to our Left Bank hotel rooms lest we wake up back home, retrieved by parents who would remind us of how much they had invested in our educations, and how it was time for us to put our shoulders to the wheel. In my case, no airmail letter from my father was complete without its built-in stinger:<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yankel Schneider, remember him, he had a stammer? So what? He&#x2019;s become a chartered accountant and drives a Buick now.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Our loosy-goosy band included a couple of painters, so to speak, both of them New Yorkers. There was the loopy Clara and the scheming Leo Bishinsky, who managed his artistic rise better than Wellington did &#x2014; you know, that battle in a town in Belgium.4 He left a ball to go to it. Or interrupted a game of bowls. No, that was Drake.<br>&nbsp;<br>A garage in Montparnasse served as Leo&#x2019;s atelier, and there he laboured on his huge triptychs, mixing his paints in buckets and applying them with a kitchen mop. On occasion he would swish his mop around, stand back ten feet, and let fly. Once, when I was there, the two of us sharing a toke, he thrust his mop at me. &#x201c;Have a go,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Soon enough, I figured, Leo would get a shave and a haircut and join an advertising agency in New York.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was dead wrong.<br>&nbsp;<br>Go know that forty years later Leo&#x2019;s atrocities would be hanging in the Tate, the Guggenheim, moma, and The National Gallery in Washington, and that others would be sold for millions to junk-bond mavens and arbitrage gurus who were often outbid by Japanese collectors. Go anticipate that Leo&#x2019;s battered Renault <i>deux-chevaux</i>5 would one day be succeeded, in a ten-car garage in Amagansett, by a Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud, a vintage Morgan, a Ferrari 250 <i>berlinetta</i>, and an Alfa Romeo, among other toys. Or that to mention his name today, in passing, I could be accused of name-dropping. Leo has appeared on the cover of <i>Vanity Fair </i>in Mephistophelian guise, replete with horns, magenta cape and tails, painting magic symbols on the nude body of a flavour-of-the-month starlet.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the old days you could always tell who Leo was screwing, because, <i>tout court</i>, a white-bread-and-cashmere-twin-set young woman out of Nebraska, working for the Marshall Plan, would turn up at La Coupole and think nothing of picking her nose at the table. But today renowned fashion models flock to Leo&#x2019;s Long Island mansion, vying with one another to proffer pubic hairs that can be worked into his paintings along with bits of beach glass, bluefish skeletons, salami butts, and toenail clippings.<br>&nbsp;<br>Back in 1951 my gang of neophyte artists flaunted their liberation from what they, <i>de haut en bas</i>, denigrated as the rat race, but the sour truth is, with the shining exception of Bernard &#x201c;Boogie&#x201d; Moscovitch, they were all contenders. Each one as fiercely competitive as any <i>Organization Man </i>or <i>Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</i>, if any of you out there are old enough to remember those long-forgotten best-sellers, modish for a season. Like Colin Wilson. Or the Hula Hoop. And they were driven by the need to succeed as much as any St. Urbain Street urchin back home who had bet his bundle on a new autumn line of <i>apr�s-ski </i>wear. Fiction is what most of them were peddling. Making it new, as Ezra Pound had ordained before he was certified insane. Mind you, they didn&#x2019;t have to cart samples round to department store buyers, floating on &#x201c;a smile and a shoeshine,&#x201d; as Clifford Odets6 once put it. Instead, they shipped their merchandise off to magazine and book editors, enclosing a stamped, self-addressed envelope. Except for Boogie, my anointed one.<br>&nbsp;<br>Alfred Kazin once wrote of Saul Bellow that, even when he was still young and unknown, he already had the aura about him of a man destined for greatness. I felt the same about Boogie, who was uncommonly generous at the time to other young writers, it being understood that he was superior to any of them.<br>&nbsp;<br>In one of his manic moods Boogie would throw up lots of smoke, deflecting questions about his work by clowning. &#x201c;Look at me,&#x201d; he once said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got all the faults of Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Hemingway rolled into one. I will fuck just about any peasant girl who will have me. I&#x2019;m an obsessive gambler. A drunk. Hey, just like Freddy D., I&#x2019;m even an anti-Semite, but maybe that doesn&#x2019;t count in my case as I&#x2019;m Jewish myself. So far, all that&#x2019;s lacking in the equation is my very own Yasnaya Polyana, a recognition of my prodigious talent, and money for tonight&#x2019;s dinner, unless you&#x2019;re inviting me? God bless you, Barney.&#x201d;<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>Five years older than I was, Boogie had scrambled up Omaha Beach on D-Day, and survived the Battle of the Bulge. He was in Paris on the gi Bill, which provided him with one hundred dollars monthly, a stipend supplemented by an allowance from home, which he usually invested, with sporadic luck, on the <i>chemin de fer </i>tables at the Aviation Club.<br>&nbsp;<br>Well now, never mind the malicious gossip, most recently revived by the lying McIver, that will pursue me to the end of my days. The truth is, Boogie was the most cherished friend I ever had. I adored him. And over many a shared toke, or bottle of <i>vin ordinaire</i>, I was able to piece together something of his background. Boogie&#x2019;s grandfather Moishe Lev Moscovitch, born in Bialystok, sailed steerage to America from Hamburg, and rose by dint of hard work and parsimony from pushcart chicken peddler to sole proprietor of a kosher butcher shop on Rivington Street on the Lower East Side. His first-born son, Mendel, parlayed that butcher shop into Peerless Gourmet Packers, suppliers of K-rations to the U.S. Army during the Second World War. Peerless emerged afterward as purveyors of Virginia Plantation packaged ham, Olde English sausages, Mandarin spare ribs, and Granny&#x2019;s Gobblers (frozen, oven-ready turkeys) to supermarkets in New York St...</p><h2>First Art for Toddlers and Twos: Open-Ended Art Experiences</h2><p>Discover the natural curiosity and enthusiasm of toddlers and twos as they explore creative art experiences designed just for them.

Scott DeVeaux takes a central chapter in the history of jazz&#x2014;the birth of bebop&#x2014;and shows how our contemporary ideas of this uniquely American art form flow from that pivotal moment. At the same time, he provides an extraordinary view of the United States in the decades just prior to the civil rights movement.<br><br> DeVeaux begins with an examination of the Swing Era, focusing particularly on the position of African American musicians. He highlights the role played by tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, a "progressive" committed to a vision in which black jazz musicians would find a place in the world commensurate with their skills. He then looks at the young musicians of the early 1940s, including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk, and links issues within the jazz world to other developments on the American scene, including the turmoil during World War II and the pervasive racism of the period.<br><br> Throughout, DeVeaux places musicians within the context of their professional world, paying close attention to the challenges of making a living as well as of making good music. He shows that bebop was simultaneously an artistic movement, an ideological statement, and a commercial phenomenon.<br><br> In drawing from the rich oral histories that a living tradition provides, DeVeaux's book resonates with the narratives of individual lives. While <i>The Birth of Bebop</i> is a study in American cultural history and a critical musical inquiry, it is also a fitting homage to bebop and to those who made it possible.</p><p>According to Scott DeVeaux, who has been called the Bud Powell of jazz historians, no single, completely inclusive definition of jazz exists; all that remains to define it is its vigorous evolution. Accordingly, jazz historians are "obsessed with continuity and consensus, even--perhaps especially-- when the historical record suggests disruption and dissent." Bebop, such a self-effacing, clownish term that in no way suggests the complexities of its sounds and rhythms, would become synonymous with a whole new musical sensibility, thought by some to herald nothing less than a revolution. DeVeaux succumbs neither to the evolution nor revolution analysis, but creates an intricate historical weave that sets bebop in the broader social and political contexts. <p> Bebop burst onto the scene more than evolved out of it. Sundry other forms, musical and literary, also blew the minds of cultural conservatives; modernism was born, exemplified by James Joyce and Arnold Schoenberg. But, unlike literature and classical music, jazz before 1945 enjoyed no such classical standing. It was a form utterly dependent on and responsive to its audience. Suddenly, that relationship was reversed; jazz became avant-garde, newly inaccessible. DeVeaux offers the reader myriad such connections, asking questions that have large cultural repercussions in the artistic and commercial realms. What happened, for example, when the gap between composers and performers closed; who, then, would "own" the music; what was the impact of improvisation, the backbone of the form, on the recording industry? </p><p> Not written for the casual jazz fan (although certainly a highly readable chronicle of popular, midcentury culture), <i>The Birth of Bebop</i> combines the historian's breathtaking overview, the scholar's insistence on detail, and first-person accounts of such greats as Dizzy Gillespie and Billy Eckstine. The oral histories and in-depth analyses of jazz compositions edge bebop beyond its usual treatment; DeVeaux presents a more encompassing, more exciting argument than the more typical evolution/revolution theories. By addressing the impact of bebop on the commercial, political, and aesthetic aspects of American culture, DeVeaux reveals it in all its richness--as artistic movement, cultural ideology, and commercial breakthrough.</p>"Authoritative and engrossing&#x2014;the inside story, full of fascinating insights."&#x2014;Sonny Rollins<br><br>"Moving far beyond the old revolution-evolution paradigms, DeVeaux . . . demonstrates how the creators of this music negotiated a position on the shifting terrain of the American cultural landscape during World War II.

Here, in his well-preserved arrows, tools, and leather garments (not to mention his own remains) was a rare glimpse of life in prehistoric Europe, and it captured the public imagination. Elsewhere more obvious remnants of the pre-classical past have long been objects of fascination: the megaliths of northwestern Europe, the palaces of Crete, the mysterious cave paintings of France. Now archeologist Barry Cunliffe and a team of distinguished experts shed light on this astonishing, long-silent world in a comprehensive and lavishly illustrated account.<br> Ranging from the earliest settlements through the emergence of Minoan civilization to the barbarian world at the end of the Roman Empire, <em>The Oxford Illustrated Prehistory of Europe</em> provides a fascinating look at how successive cultures adapted to the landscape of Europe. In synthesizing the diverse findings of archeology, the authors capture the sweeping movements of peoples, the spread of agriculture, the growth of metal working, and the rise and fall of cultures. They provide intriguing insight on the Minoan and the Mycenean past underlying classical Greek history, and on the disasters that destroyed Minoan civilization. They explore the increasingly sophisticated societies of northern Europe, revealing surprisingly far-reaching trade between different areas. The peoples of Bronze Age Denmark, for instance, sent amber to Germany in return for scarce metal, while new technologies spread widely across the continent. The book continues through the end of the Roman Empire, exploring the barbarian world beyond Rome's northern frontier.<br> For centuries, we knew little of the European civilizations that preceded classical Greece or arose outside of the Roman Empire, beyond ancient myths and the writings of Roman observers. Now the most recent discoveries of archeology have been synthesized into one exciting volume. Featuring hundreds of stunning photographs (many in full color), this book provides the most complete account available of the prehistory of European civilization.</p><p><br><strong>Barry Cuncliffe</strong> is Professor of European Archaelogy at Oxford University.

SCENE (Southwestern Ontario), 28/7/94<br><br>'Professor Barry Cunliffe takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the development of Western culture, from the very earliest Palaeolithic man to the Barbarian civilisations of Europe in AD 700.

From the early ninth century through the middle ages, to the Arthurian romances of Victorian times, the tales of this legendary figure have blossomed and multiplied. And in more recent times, there has been a continuous stream of books claiming to unlock the secret or the truth behind the "once and future king."<br><br>The truth, as Guy Halsall reveals in this fascinating investigation, is both radically different--and also a good deal more intriguing. Broadly speaking, there are two Arthurs. On the one hand is the traditional "historical" Arthur, waging a doomed struggle to save Roman civilization against the relentless Anglo-Saxon tide during the darkest years of the Dark Ages. On the other is the Arthur of myth and legend, accompanied by a host of equally legendary people, places, and stories: Lancelot, Guinevere, Galahad and Gawain, Merlin, Excalibur, the Lady in the Lake, the Sword in the Stone, Camelot, and the Round Table. <br><br>The big problem with all this, notes Halsall, is that "King Arthur" might well never have existed. And if he did exist, it is next to impossible to say anything at all about him. As this challenging new look at the Arthur legend makes clear, all books claiming to reveal "the truth" behind King Arthur can safely be ignored. Not only the fanciful pseudo-historical accounts--Merlin the Magician, the Lady in the Lake--but even the "historical" Arthur is largely a figment of the imagination. The evidence that we have, whether written or archeological, is simply incapable of telling us anything detailed about the Britain in which he is supposed to have lived, fought, and died.<br></p><p><br><strong>Guy Halsall</strong> has taught at the universities of London and York, where he has been a professor of history since 2003. His early specialism was in the history and archaeology of the Merovingian period (c.450-c.750), and he has since published widely on a broad range of subjects: death and burial, age and gender, violence and warfare, barbarian migrations, and humour. This investigation into the 'worlds of Arthur' brings him back to the study of early medieval British history and archaeology with which his scholarly training began.<br><br>"Written by our leading authority on Early Medieval Warfare this sweeping synthesis cuts through all the fantasy Arthuriana to the chaotic reality of the tumultuous years after the end of Roman Britain. With a fresh and incisive look at all the key sources, and a masterly and imaginative use of the archaeological evidence, Guy Halsall offers nothing less than a rethinking of what happened at the time of the Anglo-Saxon migrations. Readable, authoritative, and witty, this is an ambitious and wide ranging synthesis which will appeal to all who are interested in the history behind one of the world's greatest collections of myths and stories, vividly recreating the fractured world out of which medieval Britain emerged. And while some may regret the loss of the Hollywood Arthur, Halsall shows us that behind that image is a reality which is no less fascinating."--Michael Wood, historian, broadcaster, and author of <em>In Search of the Dark Ages</em><p></p><br>"An excellent book."--<em>McClatchys</em> Newspapers <br><p></p><br>"Halsall's is a very good book aimed at the general public, but it is also a very original and thought-provoking book for specialists of the period, both historians and archaeologists...It is refreshing to see a distinguished historian take the time to explain in simple and suggestive terms (sometimes even picturesque) some quite difficult concepts and arguments: Halsall does have a talent for it, using charts, diagrams, maps, and chronologies that make the book a very friendly object to its reader...[H]is argument is a cogent and well-put one, delivered in clear and clever language, without jargon, and one should definitely read it..."--<em>Speculum</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Computer Artist&#39;s Handbook: Concepts, Techniques, and Applications</h2><p>An artist&#39;s guide to using the computer most effectively as a tool offers readers a conceptual, hands-on approach to drawing, animation, sculpture, special effects, and film on the PC.</p><p></p><h2>NIV Compact Concordance</h2><p>A concordance is the first thing to reach for when you want to explore the Bible in-depth.

Nearly fifty years later, The Book of Disquiet was finally published, but because any edition or translation of this work must choose a sequence for its entries, each presents a substantially different text. Alfred Mac Adam&#39;s translation has been widely reviewed as the most accurate and vivid in English.</p><p>?This book has moved me more than anything I have read in years. I have rarely encountered such exhilarating lugubriousness... A complete masterpiece, the sort of book one makes friends with and cannot bear to be parted with. Boredom informs it, but not boringly. Pessoa loved the minutiae of what we care to deem the ordinary life, and that love enriches and deepens his art. Paul Bailey, The Independent ?It could not have been written in England: there is too much thought racing hopelessly around. The elegance of the style, well conveyed in what seems to be a more than adequate translation, is an important component and a very ironic one. The diary disturbs from beginning to end? There is a distinguished mind at work beneath the totally acceptable dullness of clerking. The mind is that of Pessoa? Anthony Burgess, Observer<br><br>Many British reviewers have pegged Pessoa as a great long-lost modernist, but he also calls up echoes of Beckett's exquisite boredom; the dark imaginings of Baudelaire; Melville's evasive confidence man; the dreamscapes of Borges; even the cranky hermeticism of Witold Gombrowicz (<i>VLS</i>)<br><br>It was a real bonus when Serpent's Tail published The Book of Disquiet, a meandering, melancholic series of reveries and meditations?Pessoa's amazing personality is as beguiling and mysterious as his unique poetic output.

Fairbairn and Edith Jacobson, and correlates the authors own work with that of Margaret Mahler. The theory of object relations can be applied to both psychoanalytic technique and psychoanalytic psychotherapy - and to narcissism, both normal and pathological, in middle age. An entire section of this book is devoted to group phenomena, expanding on the classical psychoanalytic theory of group psychology and demonstrating the effects of regressive processes to be found in various kinds of groups. Essentially the work places special emphasis on the temptations and dangers to individual members of groups and to their leaders, temptations and dangers resulting from the activation of regressive processes. The final section of the book brings together concepts of object relations and group processes to examine the complicated interactions within a couple and between couples and groups. In this context, the author offers an original psychoanalytic formulation of love and its psychopathology.</p><p></p><h2>Early Christianity in Contexts: An Exploration across Cultures and Continents</h2><p>This major work draws on current archaeological and textual research to trace the spread of Christianity in the first millennium.

And how did Christianity in turn influence or reshape the local culture? The book's careful attention to local realities adds depth and concreteness to students' understanding of early Christianity, while its broad sweep introduces them to first-millennium precursors of today's variegated, globalized religion.

As far as I can see the newest findings and excavations are integrated into the manuscript, and the fact that 'Christianity outside the boundaries' (of the Roman Empire) is included makes the book so valuable.

It's an open-and-shut case, as far as Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel is concerned. Except...Maciver's father died in an almost identical manner ten years earlier, and "Fat Andy" was the investigating officer. Pal's strange and strained relationship with his beautiful, enigmatic stepmother, Kay Kafka, also raises warning flags. And the family's shady corporate dealings carry two apparent acts of self-slaughter far beyond the borders of Yorkshire, causing policeman Peter Pascoe to question his superior's reticence...and his motives.</p></p><p><p>Hailed by the <em>New York Times</em> as "the master of form and sorcerer of style," Reginald Hill is undoubtedly at the top of his form in this gripping story of a mysterious death that echoes one in the past.</p><p>"Somewhere distantly a church clock began to strike midnight. In the muffling fog, it sounded both familiar and threatening, like the bell on a warning buoy tolled by the ocean's rhythmic swell."</p><p><strong>Good Morning, Midnight</strong></p><p>Yorkshire's coppers Andy Dalziel and Peter Pascoe are investigating the suicide of prominent businessman Pal Maciver. It seems to be a clear-cut case: he shot himself while sitting at his desk in his locked study.</p><p>But things are not quite what they seem. When Pascoe digs deeper, he finds threads going back to another, almost identical death -- that of Maciver's father. And even more disturbing: Pascoe's boss, Detective Superintendent Dalziel, was the officer on that case.</p><p>With Dalziel checking his every move, Pascoe is forced to lead his own investigation, plunging into the past to uncover truths about the Maciver family, particularly Pal's relationship with his step-mother, the beautiful and enigmatic Kay Kafka. He soon realizes that the implications of Maciver's death stretch far beyond the borders of Yorkshire. And when a key witness -- exotic hooker Dolores, "Lady of Pain" -- disappears, the death takes on a far more complicated and mysterious face.</p>Reginald Hill brings us a brilliant new Dalziel and Pascoe novel, featuring a chilling Mid-Yorkshire mystery. <br> <br>Like father like son&#x2026; <br> <br>But heredity seems to have gone a gene too far when Pal Maciver's suicide in a locked room exactly mirrors that of his father ten years earlier. <br> <br>In each case accusing fingers point towards Pal's stepmother, the beautiful enigmatic Kay Kafka. But she turns out to have a formidable champion, Mid-Yorkshire's own super-heavyweight, Detective Superintendent Andrew Dalziel. <br> <br>DCI Peter Pascoe, nominally in charge of the investigation, finds he is constantly body-checked by his superior as he tries to disentangle the complex relationships of the Maciver family. <br> <br>At first these inquiries seem local and domestic. What really happened between Pal and his stepmother? And how has key witness and exotic hooker Dolores, Our Lady of Pain, contrived to disappear from the face of Mid-Yorkshire? <br> <br>Gradually, however, it becomes clear that the fall-out from Pal's suicide spreads far beyond Yorkshire. To London, to America. Even to Iraq. But the emotional epicentre is firmly placed in mid-Yorkshire where Pascoe comes to learn that for some people the heart too is a locked room, and in there it is always midnight.</p><h2>Scholastic Rhyming Dictionary</h2><p>The new edition of the SCHOLASTIC RHYMING DICTIONARY has been completely redesigned to become a kid-friendly resource for finding that perfect rhyme, whether for poetry, prose, song writing, etc.<br><br>Organized by vowel sounds and final syllables, this illustrated rhyming dictionary uses its own easy-to-use, accurate pronunciation system.

Meanwhile Arutha's nemesis, the Crawler, is once again at work seeding the land with unrest and fear. James and Jazhara lead the investigation, moving from Krondor's sewers to the bleak cliffs of distant Haldon Head, overlooking the place where the Tear was lost and more than one ship has met its end.

UNESCO's report grew into this fine and highly useful collection of experiments in the biological, geological, and atmospheric sciences. The experiments illustrate relatively simple facts--how static electricity can be concentrated, how liquids change to gases, how water is purified by passing through charcoal--with only minimal interpretation. It is therefore best used as a companion to a school primer or science encyclopedia. Now revised and updated, <i>700 Science Experiments for Everyone</i> retains its emphasis on readily available materials, making this an especially useful resource for home-schoolers and for anyone with an urge to learn firsthand how the physical world works. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><h2>Nixon: The Education of a Politician 1913-1962</h2><p>From acclaimed biographer Stephen E. Ambrose comes the life of one of the most elusive and intriguing American political figures, Richard M. Nixon. From his difficult boyhood and earnest youth to bis ruthless political campaigns for Congress and Senate to his defeats in &#39;60 and &#39;62, Nixon emerges life-size in all his complexity. Ambrose charts the peaks and valleys of Nixon&#39;s first fifty years -- his critical support as a freshman congressman of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan; his involvement in the House Committee on Un-American Activities; his aggressive pursuit of Alger Hiss; his ambivalent relationship with Eisenhower; and more. It is the consummate biography; it is a stunning political odyssey.</p><p><b>Stephen E. Ambrose</b> is the author of the definitive and highly acclaimed two-volume biography of Dwight D. Eisenhower, editor of the Eisenhower Papers, and Professor of History at the University of New Orleans. His other books include <i>Pegasus Bridge.</i><p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>FRANK AND HANNAH 1878-1912</b> </p><p> Richard Nixon had no famous ancestors, nor any who were rich. There was not a political leader among them. He came from humble folk and was born in the turn-of-the-century California equivalent of a log cabin. </p><p> On his father's side, his progenitors were generally loud, boisterous, emotional, and Methodist. On his mother's side, they were generally quiet, restrained, unemotional, and Quaker. What they had in common was a penchant for taking risks. They were men and women unafraid to move on west with the frontier. </p><p> Nixon's maternal ancestors were Germans who came to England to fight for Cromwell, and who received as their pay an estate in Timahoe, Ireland. Their name was anglicized from Melhausen to Milhous. In Ireland, the Milhouses became Quaker converts of William Penn, and in 1729 Thomas Milhous and his family migrated to Chester County, Pennsylvania. A century later, his descendants were living in a Quaker colony in Ohio. In 1854, when Richard's grandfather, Franklin Milhous, was six years old, the family moved west again, to Jennings County, Indiana. The family was abolitionist, and the farm was a way station on the Underground Railroad. In 1879 Franklin Milhous, a widower at age twenty-eight, married Almira Burdg. Together they raised two sons and seven daughters; the daughters included Richard Nixon's mother, Hannah, born in 1885. </p><p> The Milhouses were gentle Quaker folk, living an unpretentious and frugal life. Almira was a schoolteacher; Franklin, a farmer. Ordinary though their occupations were, they shared an urge to migrate. California beckoned, for all its usual reasons -- the agreeable climate, the orange groves, the space, the low price of land -- and because in 1887, just east of Los Angeles, the Society of Friends had founded a Quaker community, Whittier, named for the famous Quaker poet, John Greenleaf Whittier. The founders chose a site away from the railroad line, a site suitable for the peaceful, conservative Quakers, who wanted to grow their crops and live their lives away from the city and the hurly-burly of modern life. The lure proved irresistible to many Indiana Quakers, including nearly the whole of the large Milhous clan. Whittier soon became the largest Quaker colony in the United States. </p><p> In 1897 Franklin, his mother, his wife Almira, and his nine children made the move. They brought with them the doors, window frames, and much of the lumber from the farmhouse in Indiana. Franklin loaded it on a freight car, along with his livestock. On the outskirts of Whittier he planted orange groves and a nursery. A good husbandman, he was successful enough to become a prominent member of the community, well known for his honesty. His children helped him graft the plants; he guaranteed the pedigree and hardiness of each plant, and if it sickened and died, or did not grow true, he would replace it. He also traded actively in real estate. He saved enough money to establish a trust fund at Whittier College for his grandchildren's education. </p><p> While Franklin tended the crops, Almira made their home into a center for social and religious activities, with her dining room as the focus of events. She loved gathering the constantly growing Milhous family around her; in time her family reunions ran to forty and fifty people. They used "thee" and "thou" and other Quaker expressions in their ordinary speech. Religion, work, and family were the center and almost the circumference of their existence. The religion was neither overbearing nor overpowering, rather peaceful and comforting, but it was always there -- in speech, in dress, in mannerisms, in daily prayers and Bible readings. It was a religion without doctrines, one that put a great stress on individual conscience and responsibility. </p><p> Franklin was a jovial man, liked by everyone and adored by his family. He took Almira and the children on trips, to San Francisco and Yosemite. "Father loved music," Hannah later told reporter Bela Kornitzer. "He sang in the church choir and played the organ. Later on, he took up the accordion. Evenings, he used to sing hymns and then read aloud to us. His favorite tale was James Whitcomb Riley's <i>Bear Story."</i> Hannah said her mother Almira "was even more appreciative of the pleasures of life....She loved social contacts and special events, whether in our home, picnics at the park, at the beach, the mountains, or at church. She loved to work in the yard, tending her plants or caring for her chickens." As parents, Hannah recalled, "Father and Mother were full of love, faith and optimism. I don't recall ever seeing them in despair....[They] never talked loud -- never yelled orders." </p><p> Richard Nixon had vivid memories of his grandmother Almira. "My grandmother set the standards for the whole family. Honesty, hard work, do your best at all times -- humanitarian ideals. She was always taking care of every tramp that came along the road....She had strong feelings about pacifism and very strong feelings on civil liberties. She probably affected me in that respect. At her house no servant ever ate at a separate table. They always ate with the family. There were Negroes, Indians and people from Mexico -- she was always taking somebody in." </p><p> Most of all, Almira held the family together. "Every year at Christmas and usually once during the summer we had a family reunion....She was a prolific letter writer. On birthdays she composed rhymes and couplets and sent them to us." She used the plain speech, "thee" and "thou," exclusively, but her daughters did not use it with their children. </p><p> Almira was a staunch Republican, as were most Quakers with their abolitionist backgrounds and dedication to hard work and thrift. "She virtually worshipped Lincoln," Richard Nixon later recalled. "On my thirteenth birthday she gave me, in addition to a very welcome five-dollar bill, a picture of her idol. Underneath, written in her own hand, was the last part of Longfellow's <i>Psalm of Life.</i> I can remember part of it even now: </p><p> <i>Lives of great men oft' remind us,<br> We can make our lives sublime,<br> And departing, leave behind us,<br> Footprints on the sands of time."</i> </p><p> Almira and Franklin Milhous' emphasis on religion, family, and duty dominated Hannah's youth, and left her with lifelong values. To an outsider her life may have seemed dull and dispiriting, her boundaries limited by the backwater town where nothing ever happened, but she found Whittier a source of strength and comfort. Her father gave her security; her mother, inspiration and guidance; her sisters and brothers and the entire Quaker community provided playmates aplenty, while church, school, and work were outlets for her energy. </p><p> Discipline in the family was done verbally rather than physically, and the words of criticism were spoken softly rather than shouted. "Father never paddled us," Hannah recalled in her old age. "Mother switched my ankles once with an apple twig." By high-school age, she had a dark, brooding look. Of medium height, she was exceedingly slender, bony in her shoulders and face. She usually did up her long black hair in a knot. Her eyes were dark and deep-set. Her lips were narrow and pursed, her mouth a bit too wide for her narrow face. Her nose was deep and broad at the nostrils, narrow and pinched at the top. The line of the curve looked a bit like a ski jump, a trait her son Richard inherited. All the photographs taken of her during her adolescence show a serious, almost forbidding face, and the testimony of her childhood friends and family agrees that she was indeed a serious young lady. </p><p> She was no great beauty, and she had no talent that set her apart from the community, aside from her devotion to her religion, which even in Quaker Whittier went beyond the norm. One of her brothers-in-law thought she was too gentle, too soft-willed, and called her "the angel unaware." But an acquaintance found her to be "cranky and Puritanical" and a family friend dismissed her as a "colorless little thing." She did not appeal to the boys -- one of her sisters said, "Hannah sometimes went out with a group but she never had a single date...." </p><p> After graduating from Whittier High School, Hannah entered Whittier College, which she attended for two years before dropping out to teach school. On February 15, 1908, at a social gathering at the Friends Church in East Whittier, she met Frank Nixon. Whatever impression she made on the other young men in the community, she swept Frank oft his feet. He walked her home that night, and as he later testified, "I immediately stopped going with the five other girls I was dating, and I saw Hannah every night." </p><p> Frank Nixon had arrived in California a year earlier, marking the end of a westward migration of Nixons that had begun in the seventeenth century, when Frank's ancestors had moved over to County Wexford, in Ireland, from Scotland. The name, in Celtic, was variously spelled Nicholl, Nicholson, Nicholas, Nickson, and Nickerson, all meaning, roughly, "he wins" or "he faileth not." In the 1730s the Nixons became part of that great wave of emigration of Scotch-Irish to America. Later critics of Richard Nixon, referring to him as a "black Irishman," missed the truth. Whatever the cause of the adult Nixon's dark moods, introspection, and depression, it was not Irish blood, at least not such as any Catholic citizen of the Irish Republic would recognize. </p><p> James Nixon was the first to come to America. He settled in New Castle County, Delaware, within twenty miles of Hannah Milhous' ancestor Thomas. James became a substantial, if not prominent, citizen; his will, dated May 16, 1773, included a sixty-pound bequest to his wife, Mary, forty-five pounds to his daughters, a hundred-acre farm to his son George, and two slaves to his other son, James, Jr. Both sons fought in the Revolution, George crossing the Delaware with Washington to fight in the Battle of Trenton, and both moved west after independence, following the frontier to Ohio. George Nixon III enlisted with Company B, 73rd Ohio, in 1861, and fought and died in the Battle of Gettysburg. He is buried in the national cemetery. He left behind eight children, including a son, Samuel Brady Nixon. </p><p> On April 10, 1873, Samuel, then aged twenty-six, married a twenty-year-old schoolteacher, Sarah Ann Wadsworth. They had five children, three boys and two girls. The second-oldest, Francis Anthony Nixon, was always called Frank. He was born on December 3, 1878, in Vinton County, Ohio; he became Richard Nixon's father. </p><p> Shortly after Frank's birth, Sarah contracted tuberculosis, the most dreaded disease of the nineteenth century, thought erroneously to be inherited. Samuel sold his farm, piled the children into a covered wagon, and headed south for Georgia and the Carolinas, where he hoped Sarah might recover in the warmer climate. But her condition worsened, then became acute. In despair Samuel returned to Ohio, where, in January 1886, Sarah died in her father's home. </p><p> Frank went to live with an uncle, while his father, Samuel, tried to overcome his grief and poverty. Samuel worked in a pottery factory, taught school in Vinton, and carried the mail. He eventually saved enough money to buy a forty-acre farm and bring Frank home. "When we moved there," Frank's younger brother, Ernest, remembered, "Dad's only assets were a five-dollar bill and a hen setting on a nest of eggs. He gave those last dollars to the man who helped us move. Still, we never begged, nor did we let on we were next to destitute. He said: 'Here we are and it's root, hog, or die.'" </p><p> In 1890, when Frank was eleven years old, Samuel remarried. Frank's stepmother was harsh, demanding, even cruel. "She was hard and beat Frank," a relative recalled. </p><p> He had other problems. "Frank and I attended a one-room country school, known as Ebenezer, miles from home," Ernest later reported. "We were newcomers; poor, strange, and badly dressed. The big boys would follow us home through the woods to pick a fight. Frank was the more aggressive of us, slow to anger but a wild bull if things went too far." </p><p> Frank could not put up with this stepmother, school, or poverty. At fourteen, only past the fourth grade, a consequence of all the disruptions in his life, he quit school and ran away from home. He took a job as a hired hand with a local farmer at $13 per month, plus the right to put a calf he had bought on the pasture. In the fall he sold the fatted calf. He had promised to send his earnings home to his family, but, as Ernest related, instead he used the profit from the sale on his wardrobe. "He seemed to take keen delight in showing his former classmates that he was dressed just a bit better and was more mannerly. He acquired a pride that became the armor of his body and soul." </p><p> Life as a farmhand, however, had little appeal. "We usually had milk and bread for dinner," Frank recalled. "Fifty to seventy-five cents a day was just about tops in wages for a farmhand in those days." Restless by nature, skilled with his hands, he was willing to work. "The dignity of labor was...my brother's philosophy," Ernest declared. "He liked to quote the Scripture: 'In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.'" He became a jack-of-all-trades, and something of a rolling stone, as he journeyed across Ohio, taking jobs as a glass worker, potter, house painter ("I even painted Pullmans at one time"), potato farmer, telephone linesman, motorman, and carpenter. (Ernest stayed in school, eventually earned a Ph.D., and became a professor at Penn State.) </p><p> Frank did not prosper, he did not starve, he did not improve his station in life. He knew a great deal about machines and tools, little about people. He was argumentative, cantankerous, opinionated; he shouted a great deal; he was critical of his bosses; small wonder that every spring found him working at a new job. </p><p> Like Hannah Milhous, Frank was deeply religious. Unlike her, he was demonstrative about it. He came from a long line of frontier, fundamentalist, Bible-thumping Methodists, which placed him in a tradition about as different from that of the Quakers as one Protestant sect can be from another. The Methodists were loud, in their sermons, in their hymns, in their greetings, in everything. They had a set of strict rules for folks to live by and were dogmatic about them. These precepts both fit and helped shape Frank's personality. Hannah's Quakerism led her to love God; Frank's Methodist faith led him to fear God. </p><p> Neither Hannah nor Frank ever smoked or drank. In Hannah's case, no one around her did either, but in Frank's case abstaining was far more difficult. He lived in many a rough environment, working beside roustabouts of all types, men who tempted him with their tobacco, whiskey, and tales of amorous adventures. He never gave in, a mark of both the depth of his religion and the strength of his willpower. Nor did he abstain through avoidance -- he led a hectic social life, with many dates and parties. </p><p> He was a handsome young devil, of average height but big in the shoulders and hands, as befit a workingman. When dressed for a social event, he wore his dark hair slicked down and precisely parted. He had a fine full face, a strong but not oversized no...</p></p><h2>Heremakhonon: A novel</h2><p>Veronica Mercier, a sophisticated Caribbean woman teaching and living in Paris, journeys to West Africa in pursuit of her "identity."

A poem rose in him like spring water.<br>Shouts exploded behind him.<br>&#x201c;Stag, a big one!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Get it!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Kill it! Kill it!&#x201d;<br>Men boiled past Finn, waving their spears and howling their hunger. His instincts briefly merged with theirs. His fingers tightened on the shaft of his spear, his muscles contracted for heft and hurl.<br>But the poem stopped him. The poem, growing in him.<br>&#x201c;Hold where you are!&#x201d; he cried. The two young hounds, Bran and Sceolaun, whined, but stood.<br>The men found it harder to obey. Momentum had already carried them past him. They were hunters and a stag was running. But they were also warriors of the <em>F�anna</em>, and he was the new leader of their particular <em>f�an</em>of nine.<br>He called himself Finn Mac Cool.<br>Planting their spears on the slope to brace themselves, the <em>f�nnidi</em>watched with regret as the deer leaped from one limestone outcropping to another. When it disappeared from sight, their eyes turned toward Finn.<br>&#x201c;You let a fine fat stag get away,&#x201c; accused Conan Maol, Conan the Hairless. &#x201c;And us starving.&#x201d;<br>Dark, slender Cailte added, &#x201c;I could have run him down and eaten the entire animal myself.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You could have done,&#x201c; Finn said amiably. &#x201c;But then he&#x2019;d be gone, all that grace and beauty destroyed. And you&#x2019;d just be hungry again tomorrow. A creature that splendid can serve a better purpose surely than swelling your belly.&#x201d;<br>His men exchanged glances. They were beginning to recognize a certain cadence when it crept into the speech of their newly appointed <em>r�gf�nnid</em>. Fionn son of Cuhal was a dedicated hunter. But when the impulse to poetry seized him, everything else must wait. His band had already learned that much about him.<br>With a last wistful glance after the lost deer, they formed a circle around their leader, crossed their legs, and sat. The ground was cold. They ignored discomfort.<br>Finn remained standing. His eyes were turned northward. The jagged peaks of the Twelve Bens were dimly visible across the bay, disappearing into lowering clouds, but Finn was not looking at the mountains anyway.<br>In his mind, he was watching the red stag run.<br>His expression grew dreamy and faraway. His hair was as pale as winter sunlight, his eyes as clear as water. But when he was ready to speak, his voice would be deep and sure.<br>Bran and Sceolaun sniffed out the bed in the bracken where the deer had lain. Some of the animal&#x2019;s warmth lingered in the flattened ferns. Circling three times, the hounds remade the bed to suit themselves and curled up together. Sceolaun rested her muzzle on her crossed forepaws, but her companion&#x2019;s head was propped across her back so Bran could keep watchful eyes on Finn.<br>The cry of wild geese rang through the sky. Looking up, Finn saw black wings carving lines in silver space.<br>He nodded. The poem was complete. He recited,<br><br><em>Here&#x2019;s my tale</em>.<br><em>Stag cries, winter snarls, summer dies</em>.<br><em>High and cold the wind</em>.<br><em>Low and dull the sun, and brief its run</em>.<br><em>Strong surge the seas</em>.<br><em>In red-brown bracken, shapes lie hidden</em>.<br><em>Geese sing, fleeing south, ice on wing</em>.<br><em>That&#x2019;s my tale</em>.<br><br>When Finn stopped speaking, Donn said, &#x201c;Brrr! That&#x2019;s made me colder than I was already.&#x201d;<br>The poet smiled, flattered.<br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Winter snarls,&#x2018;&#x201d; quoted Fergus. &#x201c;A particularly nice bit, that.&#x201d; His mouth worked, savouring the words.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a grand poem entirely,&#x201c; Cailte affirmed, &#x201c;but it won&#x2019;t fill our bellies. Words are no substitute for a haunch of venison or a fine silver salmon with the smell of the sea on him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d give my good eye for some badger meat dripping grease,&#x201c; sighed the husky voice of Goll Mac Morna.<br>Lugaid suggested hopefully, &#x201c;We could still bring down that stag, the hounds could track him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Leave him be!&#x201d; Finn ordered sharply, unwilling to have the source of his inspiration slain. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find something else, we always do.&#x201d; He brandished his spear and whistled. Bran and Sceolaun jumped up and ran to him, wriggling with the exuberance of half-grown hounds. The hunt resumed.<br>Except for Goll Mac Morna, all of them were young and exuberant, brimming with barely controlled energy. They had unblunted features and blue-white eyeballs and had only recently begun growing warriors&#x2019; mustaches. They were brash and merry and thought themselves immortal.<br>Searching the slopes of Black Head, the fian poked spears into every crevice and hollow, seeking to flush out small game--hares or red squirrels, or even the half-mouthful of a pigmy shrew. They laughed and swore and shoved each other; they traded insults until the crisp air crackled.<br>Cael challenged his friend, &#x201c;If you can put one foot in front of the other, I&#x2019;ll race you to the bottom!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Done!&#x201d; cried Madan Bent-Neck, who owed his permanently cocked head carriage to a slight deformity. He wore the round shield slung across his back higher than his companions did, to conceal the uneven-ness of his shoulders.<br>Physical beauty was not required of a <em>f�nnid</em>; only strength and courage mattered in battle.<br>The two bounded away in exaggerated leaps. Goll said disapprovingly, &#x201c;Those young fools will kill themselves, running headlong on that footing.&#x201d;<br>Finn flashed a merry grin. &#x201c;Then that&#x2019;s two less we&#x2019;ll have to find game for. Think of the effort saved!&#x201d;<br>Goll chuckled. One of his eyes twinkled. The other was milky, bisected by a slashing scar that puckered cheek and brow. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Conan who&#x2019;ll be the most grateful, he&#x2019;s the laziest.&#x201d;<br>But in spite of Goll&#x2019;s prediction, Cael and Madan reached the bottom without mishap. They turned and trotted back up at a more leisurely pace, watching their footing. By the time they rejoined their companions halfway up Black Head, they were breathing hard, however.<br>Cailte said scornfully, &#x201c;Neither of you knows how to run.&#x201d; He pulled his wolf-fur cloak out from under his shield and tossed it aside, revealing a body as thin as a sapling, clad in a leather kilt and a deerskin tunic. &#x201c;Mind you, this is what running is,&#x201c; he said. He raced off down the mountain, his shield bouncing against his shoulder blades.<br>In a voice like thick cream, Fergus Honey-Tongue remarked, &#x201c;Cailte Mac Ronan is faster than thought.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He makes Cael and Madan look like old women,&#x201c; said Conan.<br>Madan bristled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fair to compare us to him. Cailte won the running championship at the last Tailltenn Fair.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So he did,&#x201c; Finn agreed. &#x201c;Therefore he should be the standard you set for yourselves. Go and catch him, you two.&#x201d;<br>Cael&#x2019;s jaw sagged. &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t serious.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am serious. And since I would never ask you to do anything I wouldn&#x2019;t do myself...&#x201d; Without pausing to take off his cloak, Finn turned and ran down the mountain after Cailte. Bran and Sceolaun frisked along beside him, barking excitedly.<br>With a whoop, Blamec set off after them. Cael and Madan felt compelled to follow. The entire band joined in, slipping and slithering down the north face of Black Head, waving their arms and their spears for balance, cursing and colliding and shouting with laughter.<br>Reaching the bottom well ahead of the others, Cailte sat down on a slab of stone and dug into the leather bag slung from a thong around his neck. He was just taking a bite of hoarded food when Finn joined him.<br>&#x201c;Want some of this?&#x201d; Cailte offered.<br>&#x201c;What is it? Och, honey fungus. I&#x2019;ll wait for meat. You&#x2019;d eat anything though, wouldn&#x2019;t you? Move over.&#x201d;<br>Cailte obligingly slid over to make room for Finn. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d eat anything if I was hungry. And I&#x2019;m always hungry.&#x201d;<br>As the others arrived, Finn called out their names. &#x201c;Blamec. Lugaid the Serious. Donn. Conan the Hairless. Cael. Fergus Honey-Tongue. Madan.&#x201d; There was a long pause while they all waited. Then, &#x201c;And here at last is Goll Mac Morna.&#x201d;<br>Goll was gasping for breath and sweating profusely. He had an appalling stitch in his side. He stopped before he got to Finn and bent over with his hands braced on his knees. &#x201c;I had to bring up the rear,&#x201c; he panted. A fit of coughing ensued. When it had passed, he added, &#x201c;Someone had to guard the young ones&#x2019; backsides.&#x201d;<br>Sceolaun ran to him and began trying to lick his face. He elbowed her away but she came right back. Her tongue slopped noisily across Goll&#x2019;s mouth. He made a strangled sound of disgust. &#x201c;Finn, call off this wretched bitch!&#x201d;<br>Finn whistled. At once Sceolaun left her victim and trotted to her master, mouth agape as if laughing.<br>Goll followed, clutching his side. &#x201c;When I was the age of these young ones,&#x201c; he said raspingly, &#x201c;I was as fleet as any of them.&#x201d;<br>Finn smiled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not your age that hampers you, Goll. It&#x2019;s your girth. You grow th...</p></p><h2>Grasshopper Jungle</h2><p><p><b><b>A 2015 Michael L.

The new world allies were ruthless at finding their foe's weaknesses and exploiting them.<br>Whether delivering supplies in tiny biplanes to partisans across the vast steppes of Russia, working furiously to understand the enemy's captured radar in England, or battling house to house on the streets of Chicago, humankind would never give up.<br>Yet no one could say when the hellish inferno of death would stop being a war of conquest and turn into a war of survival--the very survival of the planet . . .<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>World War II screeched to a halt as great military powers scrambled to meet an even deadlier foe, armed with formidable technology that made victory seem inevitable. The menace worsens in this, the second novel in the four-book alternate-history saga that <i>Booklist</i> called "possibly the most ambitious in the subgenre's history and definitely the work of one of alternate history's authentic modern masters."What got me about the Worldwar series wasn't the aliens. It wasn't the warfare (though Harry's really good at it--I especially love the tanks). It wasn't even the fact that he'd turned history on its ear in a big way. No, it was the people. <br><br>If they were historical figures, like Josef Stalin, or Adolf Hitler, or Omar Bradley, he really brought them back to life. But even they took a back seat to Harry's original characters--the soldiers, the civilians, the resistance members, the spies. Whether they were American or Russian or British or Chinese, he made me care about them, about their lives and their loves. And he made me care a lot about their deaths--the kind of deaths that happen in war.<br><br>He made the most out of cultural juxtaposition, when a Polish Jew had to fight alongside a Nazi, or a British officer found himself in a tumultuous affair with a female Russian pilot (and sharpshooter--whoosh).

Souls long for physical embodiment, for experience and sensation, for a means to express their visions and dreams. Yet it does present interesting dilemmas: in the pursuit of taking care of the body, the being takes on many responsibilities and obligations which appear to obstruct the path towards liberation and freedom. This path is a spiritual one, and it comes about from &#39;inner work.&#39; The needs of the physical require &#39;outer work.&#39; The challenge is simple: how to integrate the two. The solution requires the resolution to a crisis in faith, a crisis which each one of us individually, and collectively as a nation and a planet, experience on this plane.Let me suggest that you cannot change the world, its destiny or its karma. Let me also suggest that you cannot change the events or conditions in your own life, at least not outwardly by an act of will. You can however seek understanding of your Self, and in doing so, discover the beauty and wonder of who you are. As your understanding unfolds, the capacity to experience and express compassion and love will grow, and like the warm light of the Sun itself, others will &#39;lean&#39; towards you and grow. Events and conditions in your life will undergo a process of evolution; movement will begin. The life which you live will begin to look different; more alive, more beautiful, more exciting. Once more you will begin to view the world from the eyes of a child, and with the experience and wisdom of a loving parent.</p><p></p><h2>Paul: Follower of Jesus or Founder of Christianity?</h2><p>This book provides a broad, popular look at the relationship between Paul and Jesus. Wenham studies the Gospels and Paul&#39;s letters, systematically compares the teachings of Jesus and Paul, and reveals the intriguing connections and differences between the two. His conclusions make this volume a ground-breaking work with exciting implications.</p><p>David Wenham is Dean of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford and one of the foremost British Evangelical New Testament Scholars.This compendium of scholarly research on the relationship between Jesus and Paul is intended for a general audience. Wenham takes sides clearly and early against scholars (including Karen Armstrong) who see Paul primarily as the founder of Christianity, depicting him instead as a follower of Jesus. He goes to great pains to assemble evidence of Paul's familiarity with the Jesus tradition, including similarity of theological outlook and vocabulary. One effect of Wenham's thesis is reconsideration of the dating and interrelationship of gospel material; he sides with those who favor an early date for Matthew and with those who are skeptical of the traditional two-source hypothesis. Even readers who are not convinced by Wenham's argument will be impressed by the breadth of material assembled here. The book will prove particularly useful to serious students seeking an overview of the scholarly debate regarding Paul's place in early Christianity and some suggestions regarding points of entry. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>It&#39;s Only a Nightmare!

Here, Sullivan, who has driven cross-country more than two dozen times, recounts his family's annual summer migration from Oregon to New York. His story of moving his family back and forth from the East Coast to the West Coast (and various other migrations), is replete with all the minor disasters, humor, and wonderful coincidences that characterize life on the road, not to mention life.</p><p>As he drives, Sullivan ponders his nation-crossing predecessors, such as legendary duo Lewis and Clark, as well the more improbable heroes of America's unending urge to cross itself: Carl Fisher, an Indianapolis bicycle maker who founded the Indy 500, dropped cars off of buildings and imagined the first cross-country road; Emily Post, who, before her life as an etiquette writer, was one of the first cross-country chroniclers; and the race car drivers who, appalled by the invention of seatbelts and speed limits, ran an underground cross-country car race in the 1970s known as the Cannonball Run. Sullivan meets Beat poets who are devotees of Jack Kerouac, cross-country icon, and plays golf on an abandoned coal mine. And, in his trademark celebration of the mundane, Sullivan investigates everything from the history of the gas pump to the origins of fast food and rest stops. <i>Cross Country</i> tells the tales that come from fifteen years of driving across the country (and all around it) with two kids and everything that two kids and two parents take when driving in a car from one coast to another, over and over, driving to see the way the road made America and America made the road.</p></p><p><p><b>Robert Sullivan</b> is the author of <i>The Meadowlands</i>, <i>A Whale Hunt</i>, <i>How Not to Get Rich</i>, and the national bestseller <i>Rats</i>. He is a contributing editor to <i>Vogue </i>and his writing has appeared in the<i> New Yorker</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, and <i>Dwell</i>. He lives in Brooklyn, New York, with his wife and their two children.</p><p>&#x201c;Rollicking, ironic chronicle of a family car trip from Oregon to New York, interlaced with stories about previous trips, Lewis and Clark, Jack Kerouac, varieties of coffee lids, and...well, see the subtitle. Sullivan, who seems to specialize in quirky, uncategorize-able subjects, takes us on a journey that's sentimental but also literate, literary, amusing, informative, wicked, self-deprecating and deeply entertaining...a dazzling account of America's most archetypal odyssey, with much social history slyly and wryly inserted.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Whether you are planning your escape by interstate or merely looking for some poolside reading, Sullivan's excursions through history, National Parks, potholes, and "Cheese Country" offer plenty of opportunity for learning and fun. His trapped-with-the-family jaunts are authentic and frenetic-just like every good road trip should be-and the teasing details he offers about such things as the origins of the Indy 500 and the coffee cup lid do exactly what a good travel book should do: inspire you to explore.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sullivan puts a magnifying glass to the culture born from westward expansion, ruminating on the banal beauty of what is now mostly taken for granted outside our windshields. Like all good road books, Cross Country generates the excitement that the idea of transcontinental travel holds: the hope to find something new that we don't realize exists while standing still.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Playboy.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is a road-trip ode to all the families who have traveled by car across America. The author's many side trips make for fascinating and funny reading.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sacramento Bee</i></p><p>&#x201c;'Cross Country' is a mad rush of places, impressions and history cut into bite-size pieces perfect for digesting as a passenger along for the ride.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i></p><p>&#x201c;If Jack Kerouac went on the road these days, he'd be sipping a 24-ounce soda on a 10-lane superhighway...like his bestselling 'Rats,' which used the rodents to paint an alternative history of New York, Mr. Sullivan's new book takes another somewhat prosaic obsession -- in this case, highway travel -- and uses it as a historical road map.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;In our age of authorial specialization Sullivan is the rare nonfiction writer who maintains a catholic curiosity...he is brilliant at capturing the moods and moments of an American family road trip...Cross Country is delightful as history, but it's the tender portrait of a family driving home together, enjoying their time just the four of them, that resonates on closing the book. America may or may not "be" the road, but for the Sullivans and so many other families, their time there comes to define them.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sullivan takes us on a propulsive ride. He combines charming personal recollections with compelling musings on the history of American roads, motels, the Cannonball Run, the coffee-cup lid, and...you get the idea. By book's end, you'll feel pleasantly tripped out...wide-eyed at all the sights you've seen along the way.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sullivan's rangy, amusing account of his family's trek from Oregon to New York, gives us Lewis and Clark (and their modern-day impersonators), interstate visionary Carl Fisher, Cannonball Run racer Brock Yates, and those pleasingly mundane highlights (impromptu golf) and headaches (speed traps) of life on the American road.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Vogue</i></p><p>&#x201c;'This is the America that is calculatedly heartwarming, represented by people who are purported to symbolize America -- people who are Platonic ideas of Americans: a lobsterman from Maine, a logger from Oregon, a rancher from Texas,' writes Robert Sullivan, in the introduction to his new, white-stripe-hypnotized travelogue on (and ruminative ode to) the interstates, 'Cross Country.' (His last book was about rats. Another book was about New Jersey 's forsaken Meadowlands. Oh, we like him.)&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sullivan writes with precision, humor and empathy, his own voice carrying us along.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Portland Oregonian</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A] sprawling, zigzagging, history-drenched memoir...like Jack Kerouac before him, Sullivan clearly believes that discovery in the American road sense of the word -- meaning the quasi-patriotic reaching of enlightenment about one's nation via kinetic passage over its breadth -- remains a real possibility, minimarts, Wal-Marts, and all.

Costumes by Karinska chronicles the life and work of this remarkably talented woman, a consummate perfectionist who brought unprecedented quality, innovation, and beauty to costumes designed and executed for film, theater, opera, and dance.<br>Working behind the scenes as one of Balanchine's closest and most important collaborators, Karinska made an enormous contribution to many of the great ballet masterpieces of this century, dressing over seventy-five of the choreographer's productions.<br>This was, however, by no means her only professional association in a career spanning forty-five years. She worked with many other renowned choreographers, producers, and directors, such as Frederick Ashton, Agnes de Mille, Bronislava Nijinska, Jerome Robbins, Louis Jouvet, Franco Zeffirelli, Mike Todd, Victor Fleming, and George Cukor. She took sketches by such artists as Andre Derain, Marc Chagall, Isamu Noguchi, Balthus, and Salvador Dali and transformed them into tangible, wearable apparel.<br>The lively text by Toni Bentley, a former dancer with the New York City Ballet, is full of anecdotes from those who knew the designer, revealing a sophisticated, independent woman with great style and aristocratic flair.<br>Also included in the book is a foreword by artist and dance aficionado Edward Gorey; an essay by Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of the New York City Ballet, about Balanchine's Firebird (for which Karinska designed costumes based on sketches by Chagall); correspondence between Karinska and French actor/director Louis Jouvet; and a complete chronology of Karinska's career.</p><p>Of Barbara Karinska, George Balanchine said, "There is Shakespeare for literature and Karinska for costume." While any comparison to Shakespeare is hyperbole, Karinska was certainly among the greatest costume designers of her generation. She was one of Balanchine's closest collaborators, and her work for film, theater, opera, and dance helped define the look of an era. Among others, she worked with Agnes de Mille, Bronislava Nijinska, Jerome Robbins, Louis Jouvet, Franco Zeffirelli, Mike Todd, Victor Fleming, and George Cukor. One of the highest moments in her long career was the remounting of Firebird in 1970 for the New York City Ballet based on designs by Chagall.

He begins teaching again, embarks on an affair with a married woman from the old neighborhood and becomes a mentor to a former student recently released from jail.<br><br>Then, disaster: he is found beaten nearly to death in his own apartment.

Ray Mitchell, a former TV writer, has returned to his hometown to reunite with his estranged teenage daughter, Ruby. Eager to contribute to his beleaguered community, Ray begins volunteering as a writing teacher at a local high school. When a brutal assault leaves him hospitalized, Nerese Ammons, a nearly retired detective and lost childhood friend of Ray's, investigates. She discovers, however, that while Ray can identify his attacker, he is unwilling to disclose their identity. Anxious to end her career with fireworks, Nerese continues digging, only to find that Ray made several generous donations to poor acquaintances and recently began a romantic relationship with the wife of an established criminal. While the case looks closed, Nerese continues to find evidence of Ray's troubled past and shortsighted altruism, increasing the number of possible assailants and suggesting Ray's complicity in the crime. <p> Price's narrative, which alternates between Ray's story and Nerese's ongoing investigation, gains momentum as the mystery nears resolution. <i>Samaritan</i> falters, though, in its awkward attempts at timeliness and, more acutely, its underdevelopment. The selfish, people-pleasing Ray is a multifaceted character, but he fails to inspire sympathy, while the savvy Nerese never escapes two-dimensional limbo. Price brings the streets of Dempsy to life, however, with informed, realistic descriptions and inner-city survivors like junkie-turned-independent-social-worker White Tom Potenza, who still "couldn't pass a pay phone without flicking the coin return, still stopped dead in his tracks at the sight of salvageable debris." While the plot will keep readers engaged, it's the world into which they're drawn that makes <i>Samaritan</i> a worthwhile visit. <i>--Ross Doll</i></p>&#x201c;A whodunit with substance and suspense...Price is known for terrific dialogue, and there are moments when you feel as if you are listening to [his characters] speak, not just reading words on a page...It&#x2019;s the most interesting kind of mystery&#x2013;one in which the villain is not so easy to spot even when we know who committed the crime.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Anne Stephenson, <i>USA Today<br></i><br>&#x201c;Engaging...provocative...Price has a fine ear for the subtle tension between sentimentality and real devotion, and he understands the way that chronic black poverty plays into the needs of &#x2018;the selflessly selfish.&#x2019; If this is a novel that raps the knuckles of a helping hand, it&#x2019;s nonetheless one to grab on to.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Ron Charles, <i>The Christian Science Monitor<br></i><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a tribute to Price&#x2019;s originality that [his] characters become as distinct and real as they do...Well-intentioned Ray [is] enigmatic and fresh...Price has a great way with dialogue, [and] a better-developed-than-usual sense of structure. <b>Samaritan</b> unfolds on twin time tracks, [and the] carpentry works...Price&#x2019;s revelation of the culprit is absolutely consistent with his characters and thematically right on the money...Anyone who thinks fiction or literature too small a shelf to include the other stands to learn a lot from Richard Price.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;David Kipen, <i>San Francisco Chronicle<br></i><br>&#x201c;Giving new meaning to the term &#x201c;inner city,&#x201d; Price yields up not just the familiar, blanched moonscape of urban blight but the inner lives and jackhammering hearts of those who pace and patrol it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The New Yorker<br></i><br>&#x201c;A dream of a book...a supremely suspenseful novel (with a denouement that will leave you marveling at how artfully the author kept us from guessing the perpetrator&#x2019;s identity), but to call it a thriller would be selling it short. Part police procedural, part high-wire psychodrama, part social study, it&#x2019;s a wholly engrossing hybrid that packs an emotional wallop....&#x201d; <br>&#x2013;Tom Sinclair, <i>Entertainment Weekly<br></i><br>&#x201c;Dazzling...The perfect pace of a superb storyteller is but one of the gifts Mr. Price brings to <b>Samaritan</b><i>.</i> Razor-sharp dialogue is another, as well as his urban-poetic descriptive flair. It all makes for an extraordinary novel, with the gritty plot of a hard-edged thriller and the cosmic concerns of a streetcorner Dostoyevsky.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Tom Nolan, <i>Wall Street Journal<br></i><br>&#x201c;A whodunit only in format, <b>Samaritan</b> is that rarity, a novel of race relations written with authority, panache and heart.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Dan Cryer, <i>Newsday</i><br><br>&#x201c;Powerful...Wise...The novel is alive because writers like Price are crafting books like <b>Samaritan</b><i>,</i> about a guy who discovers the hard way what a complicated transactions charity can be...For all the homework that went into <b>Clockers</b><i>,</i> Price was never a dealer or a cop. But he has been what Ray is in <b>Samaritan</b><i>,</i> an intruder in other people&#x2019;s lives. His fellow feeling with this character goes deep. What he knows about Ray you don&#x2019;t learn by researching the streets. Instead, you prowl your own heart. It&#x2019;s one more beat that Price knows how to walk with authority.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Richard Lecayo, <i>Time<br><br></i>&#x201c;Without dictating Price&#x2019;s fiction, reality inspires his imagination, provoking a finely detailed and immensely readable inquiry into what might be called the double nature of benevolence...Where a typical crime novel would traffic in surprises and twists, Price has always eschewed the formula. The wisdom and impact of his recent books derive from his insight into just how unspectacular crime can be. The perpetrators in Price&#x2019;s fiction act less out of passion or greed than drudgery and shattered hope...On the narrative journey from mystery to resolution, Price demonstrates his usual gifts for dialogue, detail and empathetic portraiture...When a novelist stays that close to the ground, there is no confusing illusion with actuality...Wrenching.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Samuel G. Freedman, <i>Chicago Tribune</i> (front page)<br><br>&#x201c;Price is renowned for in-your-face fiction: violent, fast-paced, yet morally complex...He&#x2019;s also demonstrated a flair for believable dialogue and visual detail...[<b>Samaritan</b> is] another of Price&#x2019;s first-rate urban morality plays&#x2013;a compassionate, politically savvy whodunit that reads like Dostoevsky circa 2003...He proves himself to be one of our best chroniclers of big-city experience.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Paul Evans, <i>Book</i><br><br>&#x201c;A full-to-bursting package held together by a strong, suspenseful plot... Unknowability is the key to Ray Mitchell, the essence of what makes him such a fascinating saint...Ray is preternaturally alert, alive to the mental states of those around him. Price, through Ray&#x2019;s alertness, gives even minor characters a real, if temporary, being. And yet&#x2013;and here&#x2019;s the miracle&#x2013;because it&#x2019;s Ray&#x2019;s alertness, the novel, though various and populous, feels centered on his character and therefore strong. Price does this in few words. It&#x2019;s not a function of I.Q. It&#x2019;s not articulate. It&#x2019;s more like a prickling of the flesh...A demographic epic filled with little people who command true human feeling...&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Mark Costello, <i>New York Times<br></i><br>&#x201c;Price&#x2019;s seventh novel ranks with the best of the others...His books have the gutsy appeal of the classiest hard-boiled mysteries: fast pace, tripping idiomatic dialogue, unpredictable plot swerves, zingy sex, and genuine suspense...But [<b>Samaritan</b>] also possesses philosophical breadth, clearheaded social commentary, and a fine facility with language...Price&#x2019;s vivid documentation may tease us into thinking we are in Dempsy, New Jersey, but in fact we are in existentialist territory... So quirky a mix of virtues makes [Price] unique...Terrific.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Lynne Sharon Schwartz, <i>The New Leader<br></i><br>&#x201c;[<b>Samaritan</b>] hurtles along like the PATH train that traverses Price&#x2019;s urban landscape, weaving back and forth, before and after the severe beating of Ray Mitchell [whose] complexity is matched by the detective investigating the crime...Price&#x2019;s dialogue rings true throughout, and his sense of place is solid and of the moment.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Ellen Rubin, <i>Elle</i><br><br>&#x201c;Price is not just a gifted writer but also one who thinks long and hard about human behavior...We know from page one that we&#x2019;re in good hands, with masterful detail, vivid scene-setting, and acutely observed, naturalistic dialogue. The crime-solving framework pulls us forward but is unencumbered by the pedantic detail of a police procedural, and the depth of the characterizations is magnificent: [The main characters] and the considerable supporting cast are fully imagined beings who surprise us but never test our credulity. Enmeshed in this taut storytelling is a meditation on the complicated nature of giving, and a caution that, with ill-considered charity, we can hurt others even when we think we&#x2019;re doing them a favor. Superb.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Keir Graff, <i>Booklist</i> (starred and boxed review)<br><br>&#x201c;Richard Price is, without a doubt, one of our greatest living novelists. His voice is comic, skeptical, and at all times, deeply humane. <b>Samaritan</b> is a masterpiece, a novel that is actually about&#x2013;surprise of surprises&#x2013;the world we live in now. Violent, tender, hilarious, and heartbreaking, it is a world that, in Price&#x2019;s hands, is so ably rendered that even its smallest truths attain the power of universal myth.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Dennis Lehane, author of <b>Mystic River</b><i><br></i><br>&#x201c;It seems to me that Richard Price has taken his gifts for rendering human speech and for describing the jittery uncertainty of life at the bottom, and created a narrative filled with the sweet despair such as would come from angels looking down on us and watching us suffer.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Scott Spencer<br><br>&#x201c;The great literature of the world is derived from the mean streets, and no American writer knows them better, or can drive a story line harder, than Richard Price. <b>Samaritan</b> burns, not only with stylistic eloquence but with relentless certainty&#x2013;from each richly evocative scene, each amazingly felt character, to the next. Price writes the way an architect builds, sketching out his plan, thinking it over to the most minute details. Thus the foundations of <i>Samaritan</i> are so fundamentally valid that its presentation is a masterpiece of the form. Price has artfully concealed a haunting treatise on the nuances and ambiguities of human decency, compassion, and generosity in the guise of a superlative thriller. <b>Samaritan</b> is Price&#x2019;s best book to date.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Thom Jones, author of <b>The Pugilist at Rest</b><br><br>&#x201c;One has come to expect from Richard Price, the most brilliant of sardonic ironists, an eye for revelation in the commonplace, even a kind of modern social history. But <b>Samaritan</b> is also a subtle story of seduction and abandonment, of the dangerous luxury of responsibility, and the risks that are inevitable when one is capable of love.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Susanna Moore, author of<b><i> In the Cut</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The mastery of urban melodrama that Price demonstrated in literate blockbusters like <b>Clockers</b><i> </i>(1992) and <b>Freedomland</b> (1998) keeps growing and deepening&#x2013;as evidenced in [this] story of a neighborhood and of conflicting ways of life...A virtuoso alternation of advancing action with detailed flashbacks shows how...this mystery raises troublesome ghosts from the past, while also introducing a boldly drawn gallery of involved and potentially guilty characters...A ferocious admixture of bleak wit and sorrowful compassion...The story positively vibrates with Price&#x2019;s trademark virtues of pinpoint observation and punchy dialogue...And the killer climax and ironic denouement couldn&#x2019;t be improved upon. Magnificent stuff. If Elmore Leonard broke out of genre and were 30 years younger, he&#x2019;d be Richard Price.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>Kirkus</i> (starred review)<br><br>&#x201c;Richard Price&#x2019;s <b>Samaritan </b>is gripping, ambitious, and resonant entertainment, everything you hope to find in an American novel and so rarely do. This is the work of a fiercely honest writer at the top of his game.&#x201d; &#x2013;George Pelecanos, author of <i>Hell to Pay<br></i><b><br></b>&#x201c;I read Richard Price for the cool, spare sound of his writing, his words, the language he has in his bag that fits so exactly in his settings. The characters talk the talk; the main one, Nerese Ammons, a gem, 20 years a cop in the NY-NJ iron triangle, lays open the plot, scene after scene, at a beautiful pace. Richard Price has written a terrific novel.&#x201d; &#x2013;Elmore Leonard <br><br>&#x201c;<b>Samaritan</b> blew my mind . . .

In 1985 he also released a computerized novel, <em>Mindwheel</em>.</p><p>Pinsky has published two acclaimed works of traslation: <em>The Inferno of Dante</em> (1994), which was a Book-of-the-Month-Club Editor's Choice, and received both the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Book Prize and the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award ; and <em>The Separate Notebooks</em> by Czeslaw Milosz (with Renata Gorczynski and Robert Hass ).</p><p>About his work, the poet Louise Gl�ck has said, "Robert Pinsky has what I think Shakespeare must have had: dexterity combined with worldliness, the magician's dazzling quickness fused with subtle intelligence, a taste for tasks and assignments to which he devises ingenious solutions."</p><p>From 1997 to 2000, he served as the United States Poet Laureate and Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress. During that time, he founded the Favorite Poem Project, a program dedicated to celebrating, documenting and encouraging poetry's role in Americans' lives.</p><p>In 1999, he co-edited <em>Americans' Favorite Poems: The Favorite Poem Project Anthology</em> with Maggie Dietz.

He is currently poetry editor of the weekly Internet magazine <em>Slate</em> .</p><p>Pinsky has taught at both Wellesley College and the University of California, Berkeley, and currently teaches in the graduate writing program at Boston University. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>Pinsky, America's 39th poet laureate, brings together the likes of Shakespeare and Yeats, O'Hara and Plath, Hayden, Dickinson, and Komynyakaa on the theme of the broken heart. This is a collection of 101 salves and spells with the power to heal. The number of poems were chosen, as Pinsky tells us in his introduction, because it sounds lovely. "Why do works of art about bad things such as loss and deprivation make us feel good?" he asks. Every love and attachment brings risk; loss is almost inevitable. These laments mourn loves and friends, places and things; the title comes from Wallace Stevens, whose love is for the earth itself. Frost tells us that because of Eve's voice, "Never again would birds' song be the same./ And to do that to birds was why she came." Much of this volume is familiar, but the poems are strengthened by their setting.

In a series of compelling chapters, <i>Coast of Dreams</i> moves through a variety of topics that show the California of the last decade, when the state was sometimes stumbling, sometimes humbled, but, more often, flourishing with its usual panache. <br><br>From gang violence in Los Angeles to the spectacular rise&#x2013;and equally spectacular fall&#x2013;of Silicon Valley, from the Northridge earthquake to the recall of Governor Gray Davis, Starr ranges over myriad facts, anecdotes, news stories, personal impressions, and analyses to explore a time of unprecedented upheaval in California. <i>Coast of Dreams</i> describes an exceptional diversity of people, cultures, and values; an economy that mirrors the economic state of the nation; a battlefield where industry and the necessities of infrastructure collide with the inherent demands of a unique and stunning natural environment. It explores California politics (including Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x2019;s election in the 2003 recall), the multifaceted business landscape, and controversial icons such as O. J. Simpson.<br><br> &#x201c;Historians of the future,&#x201d; Starr writes, &#x201c;will be able to see with more certainty whether or not the period 1990-2003 was not only the end of one California but the beginning of another&#x201d;; in the meantime, he gives a picture of the place and time in a book at once sweeping and riveting in its details, deeply informed, engagingly personal, and altogether fascinating.</p><p>Kevin Starr is University Professor of History at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

He divides his time between San Francisco and Los Angeles.<b>Chapter 1<br><br>Surf's Up!</b><br><br>Most sunny afternoons in Newport Beach, Orange County, in the fall of 1997, Veronica Kay, a five-foot-eleven sun-bleached blonde Valkyrie, a junior at Newport Harbor High, could be found surfing toward shore on a killer wave. It may have cost Veronica $1,600 to do this bit of surfing-that's the fee she would collect that afternoon in Los Angeles after modeling for Union Bay jeans, J. Crew, Sunglass Hut, or any other company that was seeking a knockout blonde with the Southern California surfer look. Veronica Kay was certainly that: she had won Seventeen magazine's New Star Showcase (supermodel Niki Taylor got her start in the same contest), and was already the star of modeling sessions in Tahiti for Wave Action magazine and heading for Bali in May for another shoot. Kay was also a ranked surfer, obsessed with the waves since the age of thirteen, winning at the end of her sophomore year her first national competition at Trestles, a surf spot near San Clemente.<br><br>Without the surf, Kay might have been just another lost California kid. Her parents divorced when she was six. The split plunged Kay's mother and two siblings into poverty. Only contributions of groceries from friends kept them fed. Her brother and sister struggled with drug addiction. It was the same old California story, sadly, and at thirteen Kay might very well have been expected to follow the drill; but she picked up a surfboard instead, and in May 1996 was discovered by a modeling agency. ("She surfs," says her agent, "and it just so happens she's absolutely adorable and has an amazing figure.") Soon she had her first client, Oakley of Foothill Ranch, a maker of sunglasses, for whom she posed while continuing to surf competitively.<br><br>"The first image I saw of her," remembers surf contest promoter Allan Seymour of Capistrano Beach, "was a picture of her at Waikiki holding a board and kind of looking over her shoulder and laughing. So I figured, 'Oh, she's a model. She can't surf.' Then I found out she's one of the top short-board women in the world. I was like, 'Wow.' " With Kay's income, her brother and sister-to whom she remained devoted-got off drugs and into college. Her mother had no trouble with the groceries. "I'll model as long as it doesn't interfere with my surfing," Kay noted. "Modeling is just a real easy way for me to earn the money I need. Surfing is my life."<br><br>California writer Jack London deserves as much credit as anyone for publicizing the Hawaiian sport after his 1907 visit to the islands on his yacht, The Snark, en route to Australia. That very same year, Pacific Electric Railroad magnate Henry Huntington brought surfing to the California coast when he hired an Irish-Hawaiian man by the name of George Freeth to give surfing demonstrations off Redondo Beach to promote the completion of the Los Angeles-Redondo Beach Interurban Electric. Another Hawaiian, Duke Kahanomoku, swimming gold medalist in the 1912 Olympics, continued to practice and teach the sport. Surfing grew steadily through the 1920s and 1930s as an elite pursuit, helped after 1932 when Tom Blake patented a hollow surfboard, halving the weight (up to 150 pounds) of the older redwood models, which were so heavy it often took two men to carry them to the waves. After World War II, Bob Simmons-a 4F aerospace engineer at Douglas Aircraft (a 1935 motorcycle accident had nearly severed his right arm) who had surfed through the war-lightened boards even more, using combinations of Styrofoam, resin, and fiberglass.<br><br>Through the 1950s surfing remained a quasi-outlaw occupation, or at least the rebellious pursuit at Malibu and San Onofre of such nonconformists as Tom Wert, who surfed under the nom de surf Opai, and Terry Tracey, a.k.a. Tubesteak. It was a James Dean sort of thing, Wert later stated, a way of proving that you and the other surfers-Mickey "Da Cat" Dora, Mickey Munoz, Kemp Aaberg, and the other guys-weren't into 1950s conformity and gray flannel suits. Both Tracey and Dora had tried it in the straight world, working as clerks at the Home Insurance Company in Los Angeles. Both were fired within the week. Better to stay out on the beach and surf, protected from the draft by the calcium deposits building up on your feet and kneecaps.<br><br>Then came the novel Gidget (1957), written by Frederick Kohner, based on the firsthand experiences of his surfing teenage daughter. Fleeing the Nazis in the late 1930s, Kohner could not speak a word of English when he arrived in Los Angeles. By the mid-1950s he was master not only of English but of teenage slang and surf argot. Columbia bought the film rights to Gidget for $50,000, and the resulting movie, released in 1959, followed in 1966 by the even more successful documentary The Endless Summer, reinforced by the surfing music of Jan and Dean and the Beach Boys, made surfing a primary emblem and ritual of California identity: a daydream, an idyll, of endless youth and an endless summer on the sunny shores of an endless sea. Young men and women went down to the shore in their teens, and sometimes-the men especially-they never came back. Like the central character in the film Lifeguard (1976), they stayed on, working for the county as lifeguards or running surfers' shops, lunching at Wahoo's Fish Taco in Costa Mesa, hanging out at Jack's Surfboards in Huntington Beach, hoping for a mention in Surfer magazine, never growing up, never leaving the beach.<br><br>You could live cheaply at the beach, provided you stayed single and didn't incur a lot of family obligations. That meant remaining a kind of boy well into middle age, perhaps for a lifetime, since surfing was a young man's game. If you were rich, like A. B. Spreckels III, scion of the great Spreckels family and stepson of Clark Gable, you could become a surfing legend under the beach name Bunker before your untimely death at the age of twenty-seven. And dying in the water was cool, too, if you had a death wish, as Bunker surely did.<br><br>It was even okay if you were kind of old-forty-nine, say, as of 1995-and had a Nobel Prize in chemistry, like Kary Mullis, living in a beachfront apartment in La Jolla and surfing and trying to score with chicks two years after winning the Big One as a staff scientist at Cetus for cracking the way that DNA replicates itself, thus making it possible, eventually, to reproduce billions of copies of a desired gene in a matter of hours. U.S. Patent 4,683,202 and the Nobel Prize had given Mullis fame and financial security, but he was still a Southern California sort of a guy: with three ex-wives and two sons, hanging out at the beach, an aging but still plausible surfer, trying at once to get and not to get a life. University of California at Santa Cruz undergraduate Daniel Duane, by contrast, was barely into his twenties when he spent a year surfing the California coast while keeping a journal, published in 1996 as Caught Inside. Although it was never stated as such, the model for Duane's year and the subsequent book was Henry David Thoreau's year on Walden Pond. Duane went down to the California beach to surf and to watch, and in surfing and watching to probe, like Thoreau, what it was all about and then to write it up in delightfully sinewy and tactile prose announcing the overnight presence of an important new California author. Guys like Daniel Duane, Kary Mullis, and the others-rebels, mystic seekers, Dharma bums-were fewer and farther between on the beach by the 1990s. They were really throwbacks to the wild and crazy guys of the 1950s: rebels without a cause, existentialists, and, as in Duane's case, developing writers.<br><br>By the mid-1990s, beach dreams and the search for surf, like every other sport in the United States, had gone big-time commercial. Surfware companies such as Quiksilver, Billabong, and Gotcha, selling their lines at places like the Waveline Surf Shop in Ventura, were doing $1.7 billion a year. In March 1998, a newcomer, K2, stole Quiksilver's top rider, Tim Curran, the numero uno surfer in the United States, with a three-year, six-figure deal. Prominent surfers such as Veronica Kay and Shane Dorian could make hundreds of thousands of dollars endorsing or otherwise promoting lines of surfwear. When the Manhattan-based Tommy Hilfiger clothing company entered the surfwear business in 1997, it put an entire family on retainer: the legendary Paskowitzes, a multigenerational clan prominent in Southern California surfing circles for four decades.<br><br>Up and down the Southern California coast, from Carpenteria to La Jolla, at Malibu and Dana Point, Manhattan Beach and San Clemente, it seemed as if everyone under a certain age-every white kid, that is, and an increasing number of Asians, and the beginnings of a Latino set, but few blacks-was living on the beach or in the water as much as possible, using terms such as "raging" (stupendous), "stoked" (couldn't be happier), "barney" (stupid and annoying), "bettie" (a beach girl). Surfers knew their turf and their surf down to its ten- to twenty-yard specifics: the precise point on the beach-Old Joe's in Malibu, Super Tubes south of Point Mugu, Toes Over in Marina del Rey, and 150 precisely defined spots-where the waves were good. At Manhattan and Huntington Beach, you could find an abundance of "Newtons"-high, hollow waves. Down a steep hill near Laguna Niguel, at a little beach called Salt Creek, you could ride the tube on hard, consistent waves, not big, but clean and hollow. At the Wedge at the end of the Balboa Peninsula, just to the right of the jetty, the surf was pounding, pummeling, dangerous. For really ferocious surf, you had to travel north, up to Maverick's north of Half Moon Bay, where waves the height of a four-story building in 1994 took the life of Hawaiian surfer star Mark Foo, breaking his board and sucking him into a deep bowl called the Cauldron, where Foo's board leash jammed on an underwater rock spur and trapped him there until his breath ran out.<br><br>By September 1997, with El Ni�o in the offing...</p><h2>Murder in a Mill Town (Gilded Age Mysteries, No. 2)</h2><p>For Nell, tracing the path of a missing woman through the seedy parts of 1868 Boston just may be the death of her.</p><p>Patricia Ryan, a.k.a.

As did his stand-up comedy and his present, top-rated CBS-TV program, Romano draws on his real-life experience as a husband, a father, a father of twins, a son with parents living very very close, and a brother, to make readers laugh and laugh harder.</p><p>Ray Romano's <i>Everybody Loves Raymond</i> is the most important TV comedy since <i>Seinfeld</i>. Now he makes his debut as an author with a reported seven-figure book deal. Some of what makes his show great is captured between the covers of <i>Everything and a Kite</i>--it boasts the same affectionate, yet not cheaply sentimental, comedy that conveys actual insights about family life, an experience Martin Mull has likened to "having a bowling alley installed in your brain." The show is like <i>Married... with Children</i> with a heart or <i>Home Improvement</i> with a brain.<p> In book form, Romano is kind of like Dave Barry. Barry is funnier on the page, but Romano writes a good spritz-of-consciousness monologue. And Barry dared not utter the word <i>prostate</i> in <i>Dave Barry Turns 50</i>, but Romano provides a state-of-the-art prostate-exam reminiscence. There is no shame he shuns--not his fear of spiders, exacerbated when he splooshed one off his windshield with the washer button through the moonroof into the car while driving, nor his sexual-conquest count ("one less than the number of times I've been stung by a bee... <i>greater</i> than the number of times I've put a pet to sleep... <i>exactly equal</i> to the number of times I've been crapped on by a bird"). But Romano stole his title: when he asked his 4-year-old son what he wanted for his birthday, the kid said, "Everything and a kite." <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>Ray Romano</b> is a comedian and Emmy Award -- winning star of the top-rated CBS television program <i>Everybody Loves Raymond.</i> This is Ray's first book for children, and he's written it with his two brothers, Richard, a retired New York police sergeant, and Robert, a New York City school teacher.</p><h2>Through a Glass, Darkly: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the Quest to Solve the Greatest Mystery of All</h2><p><p><b>2018 ASJA Award-Winner in the Biography/History Category</b></p><p>Is it possible to make direct contact with the dead? Do the departed seek to make contact with us? The conviction that both things are true was the cornerstone of spiritualism, a kind of do-it-yourself religion that swept the Western world from the 1850s to the 1930s. Prominent artists and poets, prime ministers and scientists, all joined hands around the s�ance table. But the movement's most famous spokesman by far was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, whose public quarrels with Houdini over the truth of spiritualism made headlines across the country.</p><p>Known to the world as the creator of Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle had undergone what many considered an enigmatic transformation, turning his back on the hyper-rational Holmes and plunging into the supernatural. What was it that convinced a brilliant man, the creator of the great exemplar of cold, objective thought, that there was a reality beyond reality?</p><p>Though most modern sources make Conan Doyle out to be a kindly but credulous old fool, and though the spiritualist era was rife with fraud, Stefan Bechtel and Laurence Roy Stains take a closer look. They reexamine the old records of trance mediums and s�ances, and they discover that what Conan Doyle and his colleagues uncovered is as difficult to dismiss now as it was then.</p></p><p><p>STEFAN BECHTEL is the author or co-author of twelve books, including <i>Mr. Hornaday's War</i> and <i>Redemption Alley</i>, which have sold more than two million copies and been translated into ten languages.

Published to great controversy in 1977, &#34;Petals of Blood&#34; is as much a whodunnit as a political novel and satire.

He got off and stood still, his right hand akimbo, his left holding the horse, his reddish lined eyes surveying the grey, dry lichen on a once white-ochred wall. Then, unhurriedly, he leaned the metal horse against the wall and, bending down, unclipped loose the trouser bottoms, beat them a little with his hands &#x2013; a symbolic gesture, since the dust stubbornly clung to them and to his shoes &#x2013; before moving back a few steps to re-survey the door, the falling-apart walls and the sun-rotted tin roof. Suddenly, determinedly, he strode to the door and tried the handle while pushing the door with his right shoulder. He crashed through into a room full of dead spiders and the wings of flies on cobwebs on all the walls, up to the eaves.</p><p>Another one has come into the village, went the news in Ilmorog. Children spied on him, on his frantic efforts to trim up and weed the place, and they reported everything to the old men and women. He would go away with the wind, said the elderly folk: had there not been others before him? Who would want to settle in this wasteland except those without limbs &#x2013; may the devil swallow Abdulla &#x2013; and those with aged loins &#x2013; may the Lord bless Nyakinyua, the old woman.</p><p>The school itself was a four-roomed barrack with broken mud walls, a tin roof with gaping holes and more spiders&#x2019; webs and the wings and heads of dead flies. Was it any wonder that teachers ran away at the first glance? The pupils were mostly shepherd boys, who often did not finish a term but followed their fathers in search of new pastures and water for their cattle.</p><p>But Munira stayed on, and after a month we were all whispering &#x2013; was he a little crazed &#x2013; and he not so old? Was he a carrier of evil? &#x2014; especially when he started holding classes under the acacia bush near the place rumoured to be the grave of the legendary Ndemi, whose spirit once kept watch over Ilmorog Country before imperialism came and changed the scheme of things. He is mocking Ndemi, said Mwathi wa Mugo, who divined for both the ridge and the plains and prescribed a deterrent. At night, under the cover of darkness, the old woman shat a mountain between the school building and the acacia bush. In the morning the children found a not-so-dry mound of shit. They ran back to their parents and told a funny story about the new teacher. For a week or so Munira galloped his horse the length of the hills and plains in pursuit of the disappearing pupils. He caught up with one. He got off his horse, letting it fall to the ground, and ran after the pupil.</p><p>&#x2018;What is your name?&#x2019; he asked, holding him by the shoulder.</p><p>&#x2018;Muriuki.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Son of?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Wambui.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s your mother?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What about your father?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He works far away.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Tell me: why don&#x2019;t you like school?&#x2019;</p><p>The boy was drawing marks on the ground with his right toe, head bent to one side, holding back laughter with difficulty.</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x2019; he said, making as if to cry. Munira let him go after getting a promise that Muriuki would return and even bring the others. So they came back cautiously: they still thought him a bit odd and this time would not venture out of the closed walls.</p><p>She waited for Munira outside the school kei-apple hedge. He got off the metal horse. He stood aside, thinking she only wanted to pass. But she stood in the middle of the narrow track supporting herself against a twigged stick.</p><p>&#x2018;Where you come from: are there tarmac roads?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And light that comes from wires on dry trees to make day out of night?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Women in high heels?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oiled hair, singed goatskin smell?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>He looked at her furrowed face, at the light in her eyes. His own wandered past her, over the empty school, for it was after four o&#x2019;clock, and he thought: what did she want?</p><p>&#x2018;They are beautiful and wise in the ways of the white man: is this not so?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That they are: too wise, sometimes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Our young men and women have left us. The glittering metal has called them. They go, and the young women only return now and then to deposit the newborn with their grandmothers already aged with scratching this earth for a morsel of life. They say: there in the city there is room for only one . . . our employers, they don&#x2019;t want babies about the tiny rooms in tiny yards. Have you ever heard of that? Unwanted children? The young men also. Some go and never return. Others sometimes come to see the wives they left behind, make them round-bellied, and quickly go away as if driven from Ilmorog by Uhere or Mutung&#x2019;u. What should we call them? The new Uhere and Mutung&#x2019;u generation: for was it not the same skin diseases and plagues that once in earlier times weakened our people in face of the Mzungu invasion? Tell me: what then brings you to a deserted homestead? Look at Abdulla. He came from over there and what did he bring us? A donkey. Now imagine, a donkey! What have you really come to fetch from our village? Is it the remaining children?&#x2019;</p><p>He pondered this a few seconds. He plucked a ripened yellow kei-apple and crushed it between his fingers: isn&#x2019;t there a safe corner in which to hide and do some work, plant a seed whose fruits one could see? The smell from the rotting fermenting kei-apple hit into his nostrils. He felt a sudden nausea, Lord deliver us from our past, and frantically fumbled in his pockets for a handkerchief to cover the sneeze. It was too late. A bit of mucus flew onto the woman&#x2019;s furrowed face. She shrieked out, auuu-u, Nduri ici mutiuke muone, and fled in fright. He turned his face aside to hold back another sneeze. When a second later he looked to the path, he could not find a trace of her behind the kei-apple bush or anywhere. She had vanished.</p><p>Strange, mysterious, he muttered to himself. He got on his metal horse and slowly rode toward Abdulla&#x2019;s shop.</p><p>Abdulla was also a newcomer to Ilmorog. He and little skinny Joseph had come into our midst in a donkey-cart full of an assortment of sufurias and plates and cheap blankets tightly packed into torn sisal sacks and dirty sheets knotted into temporary bags. This was going to be an eventful year, Njogu had exclaimed sarcastically on seeing the odd trio, and listening to their even more odd request: how in this desert place could anyone even think of rescuing the broken mud-walled shop that had once belonged to Dharamashah of Ilmorog legends? You can take the ghost . . . memories, curses and all . . . old Njogu had said, pointing to the building, whose roof and walls leaned to one side and looked indistinguishable from the dry weed and the red earth. We used to crowd his little shop and look curiously at his stumped leg and his miserable face and listen to his stream of curses at Joseph. Soon we were glad that at long last we had a place from which we could get salt and pepper. But we were rather alarmed at his donkey because it ate too much grass and drank too much water. Within a month Abdulla had added bar services to his supply of Jogoo Unga and pepper and salt. On a Friday or a Saturday the herdsmen from Ilmorog plains would descend on the store and drink and talk and sing about their cows and goats. They had a lot of money from the occasional sale of goats at Ruwa-ini Market, and they had no other use for it, carrying it hi...</p></p><h2>Making It in the Art World: New Approaches to Galleries, Shows, and Raising Money</h2><p>Learn how today&#x2019;s artists survive, exhibit, and earn money, without selling out!

The Gospel of John was Tozer&#x2019;s favorite book of the Bible, and the focus of these writings (adapted from sermons given to his parishioners) is the Incarnation and what it means for believers&#x2019; lives. Christ came down to earth in order to lift men and women up into the heavenlies. No other New Testament writer, not even the amazing apostle Paul, presents Christ with a passion equal to John&#x2019;s, the Beloved. Tozer captures the spirit of John and presents his winsome and enthralling portrait of Christ, challenging readers to discover a fresh and overwhelming desire for Him. Readers will be captivated anew by the One we call Lord.<br></p><p>"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory..." John 1:14<br> In this day of soundbytes and celebrity gossip, there are far too few opportunities to pull away from the daily grind and really contemplate the deep mysteries of God. But here's such a thought: "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us."<br> If John's sparsely worded (but densely packed) statement describing the incarnation of God does not press against your capacity to feel wonder and awe, then consider this: How could detiy- with no beginnning and no end- cross the gulf separating what is God from what is not God? How could the infinite ever become the finite? How could that which has no limit deliberately impose upon Himself limitations? Great is the mystery of the Incarnation.<br> And He Dwelt Among Us presents Dr. Tozer's voice in a unique way- as great teacher who appreciates the mystical nature of John's Gospel while keeping his feet on solid doctrinal ground. His Spirit-led explanations will help your thoughts rise to the rarefied atmosphere of adoration of the One who became flesh so that we could know Him, become his and worship Him forever.<br><br><b>A.

Simian shapes cavorted and capered among the understory of the Mirror Zone, making their way to&#x2014;what? Apparently, to the local express station of mag-rail. Very well. She had them now, then. Memor clashed her teeth in celebration, and tossed a squirming small creature into her mouth, crunching it with relish. <br>These somewhat comic Late Invaders were scrambling about, anxious. They seemed dreadfully confused, too. One would have expected more of ones who had arrived via a starship, with an interstellar ram of intriguing design. But as well, they had escaped in their scampering swift way. And, alas, the other gang of them had somehow evaded Memor&#x2019;s attempt to kill them, when they made contact with a servant species, the Sil. So they had a certain small cleverness, true. <br>Enough of these irritants! She would have to concentrate and act quickly to bring them to heel. &#x201c;Vector to intercept,&#x201d; Memor ordered her pilot. Their ship surged with a thrumming roar. Memor sat back and gave a brief clacking flurry of fan-signals expressing relief. <br>Memor called up a situation graphic to see if anything had changed elsewhere. Apparently not. The Late Invader ramship was still maneuvering near the Bowl, keeping beneath the defensive weapons along the rim. From their electromagnetic emissions, clearly they monitored their two small groups of Late Invaders that were running about the Bowl. But their ship made no move to directly assist them. Good. They were wisely cautious. It would be interesting to take their ship apart, in good time, and see how the primates had engineered its adroit aspects. <br>Memor counted herself fortunate that the seeking probe had now found this one group, running through the interstices behind the mirror section. She watched vague orange blobs that seemed to be several simians and something more, as well: tentacular shapes, just barely glimpsed. These shapes must be some variety of underspecies, wiry and quick. Snakes? <br>The ship vibrated under her as Memor felt a summoning signal&#x2014;Asenath called, her irritating chime sounding in Memor&#x2019;s mind. She had to take the call, since the Wisdom Chief was Memor&#x2019;s superior. Never a friend, regrettably. Something about Asenath kept it that way. <br>Asenath was life-sized on the viewing wall, giving a brilliant display of multicolored feathers set in purple urgency and florid, rainbow rage. &#x201c;Memor! Have you caught the Late Invaders?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Almost.&#x201d; Memor kept her own feather-display submissive, though with a fringe of fluttering orange jubilance. &#x201c;Very nearly. I can see them now. The primate named &#x2018;Beth&#x2019; has a group, including the one I&#x2019;ve trained to talk. I&#x2019;m closing on them. They have somehow mustered some allies, but I am well armed.&#x201d; <br>Asenath made a rebuke display, slow and sardonic. &#x201c;This group <i>you</i> let escape, yes?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, yes, they made off while I was attending to&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So they <i>are</i> the escaped, I take it. I cannot attend to every detail, but this was a plain failure, Attendant Astute Astronomer. They eluded you.&#x201d; <br>Memor suppressed her irritation. Asenath always used full titles to intimidate and assert superiority&#x2014;usually, as now, with a fan-rattle. &#x201c;Only for a short while, Wisdom Chief. I had also to contend with the other escaped primates, you may recall, Your Justness.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Give up everything else and get us that primate who can talk! We need it. Don&#x2019;t fire on them. If they die, you die.&#x201d; <br>Memor had to control her visible reaction. No feather-display, head motionless. &#x201c;Wisdom Chief? What has changed?&#x201d; <br>No answer. Asenath&#x2019;s feather-display flickered with a reflexive blush of fear, just before she faded. <br>She was hiding something&nbsp;&#x2026; but what? Memor would have to learn, but not now. She glanced at the detection screen, ignoring her pilot. Beth&#x2019;s group had disappeared into a maze of machinery. There were heat traces in several spots, leading&nbsp;&#x2026; toward the docks. Yes! Toward another escape. <br>There had been six of these Late Invaders when they escaped. Now the heat traces found only five, plus some slithering profiles of another species. Had one died or gone astray? These were a social species, on the diffuse hierarchy model, so it was unlikely they had simply abandoned one of their kind. <br>&#x201c;Veest Blad,&#x201d; she said to the pilot, &#x201c;make for the docks. We&#x2019;ll intercept them there. <i>Fast.</i>&#x201d; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2014 by Gregory Benford and Larry Niven</p><h2>Taoism</h2><p>Existing in China alongside Confucianism and Buddhism throughout the centuries, Taoism has had a major impact on Chinese intellectual and spiritual life. This concise guide offers an engaging introduction to the precepts, history and practices of Taoism, in a well-designed and attractively illustrated volume that includes dozens of color photographs. <br> The book illuminates Taoism--its main beliefs and rituals, the key sacred texts, the status of the religion today. We learn that the term Tao ("Way") signifies the natural pattern underlying all cosmic change and transformation, the way in which qi (life force) is endlessly created and dissolved to form the myriad phenomena of the universe. Focusing on one's development as an individual and on establishing harmony with nature, Taoism teaches that to achieve order and harmony in one's own life and in the cosmos, one must learn to perceive the Tao in nature and to act--or refrain from acting--in accordance with it. The idea of strengthening oneself through attunement with natural forces is also applied to the preservation of the body through the quest for longevity. Oldstone-Moore also illuminates the history of Taoism, ranging from its founding by Laozi, who is believed to have written the <em>Tao Te Jing</em>, the main text of Taoist thought, to the religion's decline in the early twentieth century, due to the impact of anti-religious movements, the most radical of which was Chinese Communism, to its recent resurgence.<br> Elegantly designed and beautifully illustrated, this volume would make a wonderful gift for someone interested in Eastern religion or Chinese culture.</p><p><br><strong>Jennifer Oldstone-Moore</strong> is Assistant Professor in the Department of Religion, Wittenbergy University, Springfield, Ohio. She is also the author of <em>Confucianism.</em><br>This is the latest addition to an acclaimed series of religious primers from Oxford. Having established herself as a first-rate tutor in her book on Confucianism, Oldstone-Moore now delves into the origins and fundamental themes of Taoism. At its core is the Tao, which Oldstone-Moore describes as "a nameless, formless, all-pervasive power which brings all things into being and reverts them back into non-being in an eternal cycle." The discipline of Taoism is to stay in unity with the Way of the Tao, meaning to live in alliance with this powerful source that dictates the natural order of the world. The premise is simple enough, yet the ancient tradition of Taoism is notoriously hard to define. It's been an ever-evolving religion that is constantly absorbing fresh revelations and new approaches. What makes this a particularly helpful resource is that Oldstone-Moore is willing to organize and explain many of the complicated elements of Taoism, such as its historical origins (debatable, but possibly going back to 403-221 B.C.E.); its love-hate relationship to Confucianism and Buddhism; its magical components; its elaborate entourage of gods and goddesses; and its emphasis on longevity. Oldstone-Moore occasionally lapses into academic writing (she's a professor at Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio), making the text somewhat dry for casual reading. But for anyone who wants a solid overview of a complex and influential tradition (which the author says has led to numerous advances including gunpowder, magnetic compasses and the art of feng shui), this is a fine starting place. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mean Dads for a Better America: The Generous Rewards of an Old-Fashioned Childhood</h2><p><p>From the stand-up comedian and popular host on the Fox News Network, a nostalgic look back at his childhood and the simple American values that shaped his worldview&#x2014;a portrait of growing up in 1970s America.</p><p>As a comedian and conservative thinker<em>,</em> whip-smart funny Tom Shillue grounds his ideas about our current culture and political climate in stories from his childhood. Growing up as one of five kids in a devout Irish Catholic family in a small town outside of Boston, Tom sincerely believes that the rough-and-tumble, rules-dominated world in which he came of age was a better America&#x2014;a time and place that made him into the well-adjusted, happy, successful man he is today. </p><p>In <em>Mean Dads for a Better America</em>, Tom reminisces about his childhood, his family, and the traditional values he cherishes. He takes us back to a time when neighbors disciplined each other&#x2019;s children without fear of being sued, when kids made it to the family table for dinner, when parents&#x2019; rules were gospel, when the occasional fistfight was considered a fair way to solve a problem, and when children were free to roam, make mistakes, and experience the first tastes of independence. </p><p>On the Fox News Network, Tom debates, debunks, and entertains with his hilarious approach to issues of the day. Here, he brings that talent and wisdom to the page, tackling the issues that confound many Americans, like our hypersensitive culture and overzealous parenting. As Tom celebrates the stability of family life and the sanity of days gone by, he encourages us to hold on to our sense of humor and look back at our own lives, as we work towards creating a better future for ourselves and our kids, all while making us laugh.</p></p><p><p><strong>As American As Apple Pie, As Wholesome As A Good Playground Rumble</strong></p><p>In a world of helicopter parents, overscheduled children, hamstrung teachers, and entitled teenagers, one sometimes wonders if imagination, determination, dedication, and good old respect have gone the way of the dinosaur. In <em>Mean Dads for a Better America</em>, comedian and Fox News host Tom Shillue tells tales of his own childhood and uses them to show how simple American values shaped his worldview.</p><p>Raised in Norwood, Massachusetts, in a large Irish Catholic family, Tom grew up in the 1970s, but as far as his parents were concerned, it was still the 1950s. And that suited Tom just fine&#x2014;whether he was serving Mass as an altar boy after school (while trying desperately to hide his sneakers from the nuns), dealing with playground tough guys by using his mother's time-tested aphorisms like &#x201c;sticks and stones,&#x201d; or learning the evils of Meat Loaf&#x2019;s lyrics by being subjected to a dramatic reading of them by his father, Tom was able to navigate the perils of childhood with good humor. And through it all, love of God, Country, and Family kept him grounded.&nbsp;</p><p>With charming, honest stories about his family and his road to adulthood, Tom Shillue takes a unique approach to addressing many of the issues that confound American parents today&#x2014;our permissive culture, political correctness, overzealous parenting, and the dominance of technology over good old-fashioned outdoor play. <em>Mean Dads for a Better America</em> goes back to a simpler time while also reminding us that it&#x2019;s important to laugh while we work out where we are headed.</p><p>Tom Shillue is a popular host on Fox News Channel. He has appeared in his own <em>Comedy Central Special</em>, on <em>Late Night with Conan O&#x2019;Brien</em>, <em>Last Comic Standing</em>, <em>Comics Unleashed</em>, <em>Broad City</em>, and in the feature film <em>Mystery Team</em>. Shillue has been featured as part of the barbershop quartet on <em>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon </em>along with Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, Steve Carrel, and Sting.

I can't give it any higher praise."--NPR</b><br> Manfred Baumann is a loner. Socially awkward and perpetually ill at ease, he spends his evenings quietly drinking and surreptitiously observing Ad�le Bedeau, the sullen but alluring waitress at a drab bistro in the unremarkable small French town of Saint-Louis. One day, she simply vanishes into thin air and Georges Gorski, a detective haunted by his failure to solve one of his first murder cases, is called in to investigate the girl's disappearance. He sets his sights on Manfred. <br> As Manfred cowers beneath Gorski's watchful eye, the murderous secrets of his past begin to catch up with him and his carefully crafted veneer of normalcy falters. His booze-soaked unraveling carries him from Saint-Louis to the back alleys of Strasbourg. Graeme Macrae Burnet's masterful play on literary form featuring an unreliable narrator makes for a grimly entertaining psychological thriller that questions if it is possible, or even desirable, to know another man's mind.</p><p>Graeme Macrae Burnet has established a reputation for smart and literary mystery writing with his highly praised novel, <i>His Bloody Project</i>, which was named a finalist for the Man Booker Award in 2016.

At its heart is Conquest's critique of a deluded idealization of the Soviet Union and the underestimation of the danger it posed to the West&#x2014;the focus of Conquest's long and distinguished career (<i>The Great Terror,</i> etc.). But his targets here are far broader: if dreamy-eyed socialism has died, its ghost lives on, he says, in a mishmash of icons and fetishes ("democracy," "liberty," "progress"), held together by uncritical utopianism and reducing our intellectual culture to cerebral jelly. The original nursery of dragons, he suggests, was the French Enlightenment; today, these beasts dwell in academic corridors, where professors speak in jargon and channel the repressive spirit of the medieval Inquisition. His St. George, bearing the banner of the "Law-and-Liberty" tradition, is English-speaking: the United States and the United Kingdom. Responding to the war against Islamist barbarians, Conquest assails veneration of the U.N., the EU, the International Criminal Court, a knee-jerk intellectual anti-Westernism and the presumption that benevolent colonial intervention is necessarily bad. This pithy book, which concludes with a strange, poetic composition masquerading as an epilogue, will infuriate as many readers as it gladdens. But Conquest has thrown down a gauntlet to which we should all respond. 3 b&amp;w illus. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Swamiji has been teaching Vedanta in India for more than five decades and around the world since 1976. His deep scholarship and assimilation of Vedanta combined with a subtle appreciation of contemporary problems make him that rare teacher who can reach both traditional and modern students. A teacher of teachers, Swami Dayananda taught six resident in-depth Vedanta courses, each spanning 30 to 36 months. Four of them were conducted in India and two in the United States. Each course graduated about 60 qualified teachers, who are now teaching throughout India and abroad. Under his guidance, various centers for teaching of Vedanta have been founded around the world; among these, there are three primary centers in India at Rishikesh, Coimbatore, Nagpur and one in the U.S. at Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania. There are more than one hundred centers in India and abroad that carry on the same tradition of Vedantic teaching. In addition to teaching, Swami Dayananda has initiated and supported various humanitarian efforts for the last forty-five years. The most far-reaching of these is the establishment of All India Movement for Seva in 2000. Awarded consultative status with ECOSOC (Economic and Social Council) by the United Nations in 2005, this organization is devoted to serving people in the remote areas of India, mainly in the field of Education and Health Care. Swami Dayananda Saraswati has also promoted several international events and participated as a speaker in several global forums, among which are: the United Nations gathering of NGO&#39;s, the UNESCO Seoul Global Convention, the United Nations 50th Anniversary Celebration, the Millennium World Peace Summit, the International Congress for the Preservation of Religious Diversity, the Conference on the Preservation of Sacred Sites, the World Council for Preservation of Religious Diversity, the Youth Peace Summit, the Global Peace Initiative of Women Religious and Spiritual Leaders, a Hindu-Christian dialogue with the World Council of Churches, and the Hindu-Jewish Leadership Summit.We are not able to follow values such as truthfulness and non-injury in our lives only because we have not recognized the subtle gains that come to us by following them.We must examine our present patterns of thinking and examine the criteria that we employ in evaluating the worth of a value.Sri Swamiji shows how what we consider as gains are not really gains and also shows what we miss by compromising the values. -- <i>Swami Viditatmananda</i></p><h2>Hearing God</h2><p>Christians often struggle with prayer because it has become a one-way conversation with the ceiling.

Why? Because Dope Inc. bared the biggest secret of a $200 billion a year multinational business, by exposing the real &#34;godfathers&#34; of the worldwide narcotics traffic - as some of the world&#39;s major banks, insurance companies, and &#34;First Families&#34; of Britain and the United States. Names were named and careers exposed. No wonder that in 1984 Boston Brahmin families in the command structure of Dope, Inc. for 200 years, opened up a series of grand jury witchhunts against political associates of Lyndon LaRouche, the presidential candidate who inspired this book. No wonder that in 1985, when the Spanish-language edition of Dope, Inc. was published, David Rockefeller&#39;s (and Fidel Castro&#39;s) friends in Ibero-America went berserk. The Cisneros family ordered the book to be banned in Venezuela. Peru&#39;s Manuel Ulloa launched a lawsuit disputing its conclusions - and lost. And Castro himself confirmed the Soviet connection, when he admitted drug czar Robert Vesco was being protected in Havana. Today, narcotics traffic has grown to $500 billion a year, turning the world financial system into a giant slush fund for corrupting presidents and destroying nations. Dope, Inc. has become a &#34;government&#34; in its own right - and nothing short of an all out war on Dope, Inc. can save Western civilization.

Kawsar, a solitary widow, is trapped in her little house with its garden clawed from the desert, confined to her bed after a savage beating in the local police station. Filsan, a young female soldier, has moved from Mogadishu to suppress the rebellion growing in the north. And as the country is unravelled by a civil war that will shock the world, the fates of the three women are twisted irrevocably together.

The Enuma Elish is one of the oldest stories known to mankind. It is a story first written down by the ancient Sumerians thousands of years ago. As a one time assistant in the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the British Museum. L.W. King provides us with a qualified translation of the tables which were originally written in cuneiform script. The Enuma Elish is receiving renewed interest from modern researchers delving into the origins of mankind, the earth, and the solar system. Over the centuries a copy ended up in the library at Nineveh in the 7th century B.C., and was uncovered by archaeologists in the late 1800s. Written to cuneiform text and preserved on seven clay tables, the entire story was called &#34;The Seven Tablets of Creation.&#34; After being translated the story revealed how the planets became aligned, how a cosmic catastrophe affected the earth, how mankind came upon the scene, and how the &#34;gods&#34; played a role in all of it. The Seven Tablets of Creation have had many profound implications since they were first discovered and subsequently published. They predate many parts of the Book of Genesis as well as other worldwide creation myths. Volume One includes this epic poem&#39;s English translation. It also includes information on parallels in Hebrew literature, the date and origin of the Babylonian creation legends, and more. Volume Two includes other accounts of creation, an Assyrian &#34;Tower of Babel&#34; story, and supplementary texts showing the actual cuneiform tablets.</p><p></p><h2>An Independent Woman</h2><p>In the conclusion to the popular Immigrants series, family matriarch Barbara Lavette returns to both Europe and Israel, as she finds romantic love and encounters the biggest challenge of her life.</p><p>Howard Melvin Fast (11 November 1914, New York City - 12 March 2003, Old Greenwich, Connecticut) was a Jewish American novelist and television writer, who wrote also under the pen names E. V. Cunningham and Walter Ericson.An unexpected sixth novel in Fast's Immigrants saga, issued 12 years after the fifth (and supposedly final) installment, The Immigrant's Daughter (1985). Once again, the protagonist is Barbara Lavette, now 68 and the matriarch of a large and successful California clan. Barbara has always been the archetypal activist (having been, variously, a labor organizer in the 1930s, an adventurous reporter in the 1940s, a defiant victim of the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s, and a vigorous supporter of the struggles of blacks and women for equal rights, as well as an opponent of the Vietnam War), and this time out she takes on the case of a young black man she believes has been unfairly treated by the police. She also, to the astonishment of her friends and family, marries again. But her continuing battles for justice, and her honeymoon, are cut short by the news that she has developed cancer. Not much happens here--there are a good many amiable meals, fond chat between family members, a discreet courtship, and the name-dropping and walk-ons by the famous that have always been a part of the series--and the ending would seem to suggest that this really is the conclusion of the saga. A muted, somewhat puzzling, addenda to a lively (and successful) series. (First printing of 100,000) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Of course, the diverse reality of the inner and outer lives of gay men defies such reductionism. And this collection of 21 autobiographical essays by gifted gay writers of varied social and racial backgrounds movingly documents the variety of gay spirituality. In total, the essays amply validate the introductory claims by Bouldrey (The Genius of Desire) that "now more than ever, the issues religion takes up are those most important to gay men" in "learning to embrace the whole of their lives." How the devastating ravages of AIDS have nurtured this quest for wholeness is eloquently distilled by Mark Doty, Felice Picano and Philip Gambone, while Michael Nava and Frank Browning intriguingly compare t the liberating gay experience of coming out to the Christian experience of being "born again." Others, including Andrew Holleran, David Plante, Lev Raphael, Brad Gooch and Michael Lowenthal, trace the lingering resonances of Roman Catholic childhoods, search for personal meaning in Jewish heritages or define the intersections of physical desire and spiritual longing. Although the essays lack uniform emotional intensity, there is surprisingly no bitterness (not even from an unfrocked Mormon bishop), but there is much thirst for reconciliation in this stellar gathering of revelations about the divine agape that unites all men of good will regardless of their sexual orientation. BOMC and QPB main selections. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.This essay collection, compiled by Bouldrey (The Genius of Desire, Ballantine, 1993), examines the struggles of faith of 21 gay male writers, including Andrew Holleran, Lev Raphael, and Michael Nava. Spiritual hunger, the need for guidance, and thoughts of death bring each author to contemplate the mystery of spirituality and the tempestuous relationship between spirituality and sexuality. Some of the men are able to overcome the malleable pubescent stage of life and resolve the raging tempest. Thus, D.G. Miller writes in his essay of stuffing his face with "Wonderbread, the bread of eternal life" to avoid the perils of hell, while Fenton Johnson writes as a Southern boy raised with manners and having no interest in crashing a party to which he has been "so expressly disinvited." These essays are passionate reminders of those who reach out for richer spiritual life. As Alfred Corn writes, "I know that I am myself because God wanted me to be whom I am, and that God rejoices with me in my life as a gay man." For popular collections.?L.

Heaven and Hell is a powerful affirmation that we are all born for heaven, regardless of background or religion, and that the choices we make in this world shape our destiny in the next.</p><p>Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) was a Swedish scientist, nobleman, and theologian who spent his life investigating the mysteries of the soul. Born in Stockholm to a staunchly Lutheran family, he graduated from the University of Uppsala and then traveled to England, Holland, France, and Germany to study the leading scientists of the time. He gained favor with Sweden&#x2019;s King Charles XII, who gave him the position of overseer of the Swedish mining industry. Later, he was given a seat on the Swedish House of Nobles by Charles XII&#x2019;s successor, Queen Ulrika Eleonora. Between 1743 and 1745 he began to have visions of heaven, hell, and Jesus Christ, which resulted in a stream of books about the nature of God, the afterlife, and the inner meaning of the Bible. He devoted the last decades of his life to studying Scripture and presenting his own unique theology to the world.</p><h2>The Light and the Dark</h2><p>The only author to win all three major Russian literary prizes (including the Russian Booker Prize), Mikhail Shishkin is one of the most acclaimed contemporary Russian literary figures.

In &#34;Terry Jones&#39; Medieval Lives&#34; his mission is to rescue the Middle Ages from moth-eaten cliches and well-worn platitudes. Behind the stereotypes of &#34;damsels in distress&#34; and &#34;knights in shining armour&#34;, of rich men in their castles and the poor man at their gates, there are wonderfully human stories that bring the period to life. Terry will start with a medieval archetype - the Knight, Peasant, Damsel and Monk, Outlaw, King, Merchant and Physician - and in the course of unravelling their role and function will meet a host of colourful real-life characters, recreating their world by visiting key locations.</p><p>Terry Jones has it in for the Renaissance. It was the humanists of the Renaissance who created the standard image of the Middle Ages as a time of ignorance, misery and superstition and it is this image that <i>Medieval Lives</i>, the book based on Jones's BBC TV series, aims to dispel. According to Jones the men of the Renaissance could hardly have been more wrong. To him the medieval period is one of endless fascination, and its people not the benighted barbarians the humanists imagined but members of a rich and vibrant culture. Taking some of the standard stereotypes of medieval people we all have--the peasant, the outlaw, the monk, the damsel--he investigates the reality behind the image. What he reveals undermines our conventional views of the Middle Ages. Peasants were not all illiterate clods, spending their short and miserable lives in back-breaking labour on the land. Many of them could read a little--even Latin--and most worked fewer days of the year than their counterparts in the 19th century. Women in the period were not the downtrodden chattels of their lords and masters but were often more in charge of their destinies than they would be in later centuries. <p>All this slaying of the dragons of misrepresentation of the medieval era makes for exhilarating reading. Jones sometimes plays too much on his Python persona. Did we really need him to dress up for the camera so much in some of the book's photographs? (The picture of him in drag as a coyly smirking damsel on page 191 is particularly scary.) Yet his own enthusiasm for his subject is infectious and this is a thoroughly entertaining and eye-opening book. --<i>Nick Rennison</i></p>"Jones laces the latest academic research with his own increasingly avuncular humour. Who says history can't be fun? In the hands of Professor Jones, how could it be anything else?" (<i>Observer</i>)<br><br>"Jones really knows his subject, he is also a passionate apologist for the Middle Ages.... and you also learnt things which made your view of the period a little more complex" (<i>Independent</i>)<br><br>"Jones is a reliable and accurate guide to his period, mercifully free from the pomposity that afflicts so many telly historians.

The Circle Ritz's condominium and apartment building's white marble facade looked cool and calm in the blazing July heat.<br>She eyed the flat Timex watch that almost covered her wrist. Punctuality was essential to Temple's work. She had no time for fancy, deceiving little watch faces that she couldn't read accurately at a glance. Good. Only twelve-twenty.<br>She got out, clicked around to the passenger's side and finally wrestled Midnight Louie's carrier through the gaping car door. Her credit card might be a hundred and forty dollars lighter, but she could swear the carrier was heavier than before. Perhaps this was the result of passive resistance; Louie had been silent and ominously still all the way home from the vet's.<br>Tilting to balance the carrier's weight, she struggled toward the condominium's back gate. Three steps took her into silk-searing sunlight. Temple could feel her hot pink top bleaching and the crown of her red hair fading to pink.<br>She was a tiny woman who didn't like to be reminded of it, not even by herself. So she gritted her teeth and took one laboring step after another, counting each one. The high heels didn't encourage efficient locomotion while toting overweight cats, but elevation was enough of an issue with her that she didn't mind. Three, four, five steps...uh. Maybe Matt Devine was by the pool working on his tan and his physique, both already perfect, but why stop now? He could help her with Louie. No, she could make it herself. Eight, nine, ten steps. The gate. Ah.<br>She eased the case to the hot concrete and sighed as her shoulder joint assumed its normal alignment. The vet was right; Louie desperately needed a diet.<br>A distant droning she took for bees in the honeysuckle vine draping the pierced concrete wall grew louder. Temple frowned and eyed the cat carrier. Was Louie growling again? He had not accepted his trip to the vet in the best of graces. The noise increased into a surflike roar.<br>Temple peered through her sunglasses toward the side street as the roar crested, then slowed into a chatter. Something large, silver and meaner-looking than a robotic junkyard dog, Terminator-style, turned into the driveway and rolled directly toward Temple.<br>She felt the nasty little twinge motorcycles had inspired since <i>The Wild Bunch</i>. They conjured visions of Nazis and Hell's Angels. Today's anonymous riders, now helmeted with obscuring black visors, did nothing to improve the image.<br>This motorcyclist wore a black nylon windbreaker and rolled its mount right up to Temple, the engine still clattering.<br>Temple eyed machine and rider, ready to dash through the gate should it or he/she jump either the concrete car-stop or her person. Then she read the hot-pink words emblazoned over the smoked-Plexiglas visor.<br>"<i>Speed Queen</i>?" Temple articulated incredulously.<br>The engine died with a final clank as the rider's ankle-boot-clad feet hit hot asphalt. One hand lifted from the handles and whipped up the visor.<br>Electra Lark's genial sixtyish face peered past the bowling ball of silver metallic paint that covered her head. She was grinning like a Halloween pumpkin.<br>"Just me. And wait a minute. You gotta see this." Electra slung a leg over the long black leather seat and engaged the kick stand as soon as she stood on her own two feet.<br>Temple watched nervously as the older woman stepped away from the motorcycle. It tilted but did not tumble. At her high-heeled feet, Louie growled warning. No chattering silver metal beast was going to intimidate him, not even after a dose of something as civilizing as "shots."<br>"A beauty, isn't it?" Electra demanded.<br>"If you like cold steel."<br>"Hot steel, honey."<br>"It will be if you leave it parked in this noonday sun for long."<br>"Oh, no! This baby will shelter in the shade of the gardening shed at the back."<br>"Has it always been kept there?"<br>Electra's open glance shifted. "Not always. But it'll be coming out a lot more now. I just got my license today."<br>"Hey, that's wonderful!" Temple was always primed to applaud another person's self-improvement program. "It can't be easy to drive one of these monsters. But, Electra...why?"<br>The woman pulled off the sinister helmet, revealing a spiky crew cut of silver hair ending in a long pigtail in back. On most late-middle-aged women such a hairdo would seem a pathetic attempt at kicky youth; on Electra it looked funky and even elegant.<br>Electra's head tilted until her ear cuffs chimed. She eyed the silver motorcycle and tried, "Because it was there?"<br>"But <i>why</i> was it there?" Temple persisted with the determination of an ex-TV reporter. "You never mentioned having one. I've never seen--or even more to the point, <i>heard</i> it before."<br>Electra's hand patted the leather seat as if stroking the flank of a favorite steed. "It was Max's."<br>"Max's?" Temple hadn't meant to sound sharp, or shocked, but she did. Both.<br>Electra's silver-metal boot toe kicked the asphalt. "A cycle's real practical with all the traffic jams in Vegas. And it is a beauty."<br>Temple stared at the thing as if it had landed from Mars. "I had no idea that Max liked--had--a motorcycle."<br>"Hey, he used it as the down payment on the condo."<br>Temple eyed her landlady incredulously. She was getting tired of learning things about Max after he was gone--long gone. Four months gone without a goodbye, with no explanation.<br>"Speaking of the condo," Temple began uncomfortably, "I had to take Louie to the vet and it cost a fortune. I might be .a little late with the monthly maintenance money, but not the mortgage."<br>"Don't worry about it, dear." Electra's waving hand ignited a shower of glints from the many rings mailing her fingers. "I know it's tough when suddenly one person is paying on a place instead of two. Besides, according to folks who know their motorcycles, this baby is worth major moola. It's a classic."<br>"How classic can a motorcycle get?"<br>"Plenty. It's a Hesketh Vampire."<br>"No wonder it gave me the shivers when I heard it coming. Why on earth is it called a vampire?"<br>"Maybe because it sounds dangerous. It howls in prime gear when the wind whistles by."<br>Temple shook her head. "Hesketh Vampire," she repeated numbly. "Any relation to a Sopwith Camel?"<br>"Well, it is British-made." Electra proudly circled her new toy, ticking off its assets. "A full-liter engine, one thousand cee-cees. Nickel-plated and overbuilt to go literally millions of miles."<br>Temple followed Electra around the massive machine, eyeing the steeply raked windshield, the fluid silver front casing--not shiny like chrome but matte-soft, classy--and the emblem of a crown surmounted by an angry rooster head above the Cyclopean front headlight.<br>"<i>Max</i> had this, really?"<br>"Yup." Electra's finger stroked the word "Hesketh" under the regal but surly rooster. "The famous Hesketh flying chicken. Now it's chicken � la queen." She chuckled and lifted her emblazoned helmet.<br>Temple just shook her head. "I don't know much about motorcycles--and apparently knew even less about Max--but this is a humongous machine, Electra. Is it safe to drive?"<br>"Ride," Electra corrected quickly. "Driving is for sissies."<br>"Can a woman handle it safely?"<br>"Safety is not the idea with a superbike, dear," Electra explained sweetly.<br>"But a woman your age--"<br>"A woman my age can use a little excitement. They say women are horse-crazy, but those ninnies are living in the last century. This thing rides like a rocket. Besides, it's a good way to meet men, if you're so inclined. I found me some guys who knew something about cycles and they taught me the ropes."<br>"Where'd you find bikers?"<br>"They're not bikers, just some older guys who tinker a bit. Wild Blue works mostly on vintage planes, but Eight-ball has played with a bike or two."<br>"Eightball? Not Eightball O'Rourke?"<br>"Yeah, how'd you know him?"<br>"He's the private detective I hired to tail the ABA cat-napper."<br>Electra looked bemused. "No kidding? Until not too long ago, he and his pals were fugitives."<br>"Fugitives? Eightball claimed he had a security background."<br>Electra nodded sagely. "And so he does; nobody around Las Vegas has been as secure as Eightball all these years. He and the Glory Hole Gang hid out in the desert looking for some silver dollars they hijacked during World War Two and hid so good they couldn't find them again themselves. Buried treasure. The statute of limitations had run out by the time anyone found out about them, and now they run Glory Hole as a tourist ghost town; it's in that string of abandoned towns off of Highway 95.1 think Eightball got so used to looking for that lost treasure that he decided to get into the business of looking into this and that. Hooked on hunting, if you know what I mean."<br>"But he had a license, he said he'd been employed in detection for years!"<br>"What would you say if you had a dicey background and were trying something new at age seventy or so?"<br>"I can't believe you know these people, Electra."<br>Electra eyed Temple for a long moment. "I'm not responsible for what my friends or acquaintances do or did, but these are sweet old guys. Helped me out a lot, for nothing. They even had to chop the seat padding down so my legs could reach the ground." She slapped the black leather again, and Temple winced. "Hated to do it, but face it, Max isn't coming back. No sense letting a primo machine rot."<br>"Right," Temple murmured fervently.<br>"Heck," Electra added, "I bet even you could ride my new baby with the seat this low. Come on, hop on. I'll take you for a spin around the block."<br>"No, thanks." Temple turned to inspect her own "baby" in his vetmobile. "Louie needs to get his breakfast just as soon as I can tote in the twenty-pound bag in the trunk. I'll pass."<br>"Chicken?" Electra grinned wickedly, donning her helmet.<br>Temple didn't honor that with a direct answer. "I've got a lot of work to get out on my computer before the WICA meeting at five-thirty. Sorry. Some other time," she added with rare insincerity.<br>Electra's platinum-gray eyebrows lofted nearly to the helmet's brim. "Wicca? I didn't know you were interested in witchcraft."<br>"I'm not. It's Women in Communications, Associated. Great for networking, and digging up freelance clients in the recession is more like doing black magic than white witchcraft."<br>"I wouldn't joke about the dark arts, dearie," Electra said with a shudder, flipping her sinister visor down.<br>Despite needing to hustle, Temple couldn't resist waiting to watch the landlady mount, expertly kick away the support, start the engine and chatter off in low gear to the shed around back.<br>Then she glumly lugged Louie through the gate, shut it and headed across the area bordering the pool, relieved that Matt Devine wasn't in sight.<br>She couldn't believe that Max had never mentioned that thing, much less using it for a down payment on the condo....He had glossed over that issue when he'd put the place in both their names. Electra was financing it, so it was simple--if not monetarily easy--for Temple to take over the payments after Max skedaddled. And here Temple had hoped buying instead of renting had indicated that Max was as serious about permanent relationships as she was...hah!<br>While these thoughts festered, her autopilot had called the elevator, punched the proper floor and gotten her off before the doors sliced together on her or Louie's carrier.<br>She walked down the semicircular hall to her door, unlocked it and sat Louie's carrier on the entry-hall parquet. When she opened the grille, he sulked inside, reduced to a resentful glare of electric green eyes.<br>"Sorry, boy. I'll feed you as soon as I drag the bag back from the car."<br>She was back in minutes, staggering, to find the carrier empty and Louie nowhere in sight. Temple sighed, slung the huge brown-paper bag to the kitchen countertop and proceeded to exercise her nails on trying to puncture the stitched-shut top. She finally fetched the kitchen shears and took several ill-tempered stabs at the tough paper until she worried a ragged hole in one corner.<br>Then she hefted the heavy bag and squatted to pour its contents into Louie's empty banana split dish. Green-brown pellets plugged the hole, then burped out in a dirty hail, scattering like run-amok marbles on the black and white tiles.<br>"Oh, holy horseradish! This feline health food is gonna break my back. Louie! Come and get it."<br>He refused to show, so Temple stomped into her bedroom to look under the bed. Nothing animal there but dust bunnies. The louvered closet doors were shut, but she jerked one open just the same. Jerk. Speaking of which, there was Max, face-to-face.<br>She studied the glossy, oversized poster she knew like the markings on her mauve snakeskin J. Renees. By now, Max, the most mobile of men both mentally and physically, had become frozen into this single, hype-ridden image: black turtleneck, black unruly hair, green stare. The Mystifying Max, vanished magician, former roommate, lost lover. Was he ever.<br>And now his past recycled: a massive silver Vampire on wheelies. It must have meant something to him, owning a classic. He must have ridden it at one time; left it behind when his act toured distant cities like Minneapolis. He must have figured a Heckwith, or whatever, Vampire wasn't Temple's speed, or he'd have kept it, shown it to her. Said, Hop on, I'll take you for a ride. He hadn't needed a motorcycle for that.<br>Temple sat suddenly on the bed, still staring at the poster. She wasn't a motorcycle moll. She couldn't see herself roaring along the never-ending white center line on two narrow tires and a bloated black belly of steel. Maybe Max couldn't see that either. Maybe that's why he'd left; she was too conventional, took herself too seriously. Maybe she would have liked it, plastering herself behind Max, wrapped up in gear with a dark crystal ball for a crown and the wind rushing at them, the road running away behind them and speed thrumming with exultation between their conjoined thighs....<br>Temple rose, then used her long, lacquered nails to peel the tape very carefully from the four corners of the poster. She folded the excess tape down on the back before rolling the heavy paper into one long white cylinder. Then she stuffed it down in the far dark back corner of the closet where the last of Max's clothes hung waiting to be taken to the Goodwill someday.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright �1993 by Carole Nelson Douglas</p><h2>Gabriele Munter (English and German Edition)</h2><p>Hard to Find book</p><p>Text: German</p><h2>The African American West: A Century of Short Stories</h2><p>The distinguished body of short stories depicting African Americans in the western United States has long been overlooked, and for a number of reasons: black writers were historically denied publication in white journals, American publishers have tended to show a bias towards East Coast fiction, and the short story has frequently been neglected in literary circles. In response to this lack of recognition, Bruce Glasrud and Laurie Champion have compiled <i>The African-American West: A Century of Short Stories.</i><p>The beginning of the twentieth century saw western American writers giving new meaning to the literature portraying African Americans. Rather than reproducing the racial stereotypes and condescending dialogue found in past fiction of the eastern United States, these authors portrayed black Americans seeking new lives.</p><p>Ranging from early twentieth-century writers such as Charles Chesnutt to contemporary authors such as Walter Mosley, the works in <i>The African American West</i> demonstrate how the West, as seen through the eyes of African Americans, has evolved over the last century. Glasrud, a historian, and Champion, a literary scholar, combine their varying areas of expertise in <i>The African American West,</i> and their introductions to each chapter of the book provide both literary and historical insight into the African American experience in the West. Containing forty-six short stories as well as an extensive bibliography, this volume is an excellent resource for scholars of modern literature and African American history and culture.</p></p><p>This one-of-a-kind anthology sheds needed light on a neglected body of literature. Gathered here are a century's worth of African American short stories, told from the point of view of a black person or featuring a black person as a major character and set in the American West. The 46 stories range widely in settings within that vast chunk of American real estate called the West; and not suggesting these gems of fiction were meant as sociological tracks, each one nonetheless contributes in its own fashion to a greater understanding of the history of the black presence in the West. Male and female characters from all walks of life make their way through these pages. Some stories have as a nucleus the author's historical consciousness; other stories focus strictly on the here and now in which they were written. Less well known names stand strong against bigger names, which include Charles W. Chesnutt, Frank Yerby, and Walter Mosley. Not to be overlooked when rounding out any public library's short-story collection. <i>Brad Hooper</i></p><h2>The Conference of the Birds: The Selected Sufi Poetry of Farid Ud-Din Attar</h2><p>RICHLY-ILLUSTRATED MYSTICAL CLASSIC<br>The Conference of the Birds is a twelfth-century Sufi allegorical poem. The story of the quest for a king undertaken by the birds of the world, it also describes the Sufi (or mystical Islamic) path to enlightenment. Though hugely popular and influential in the Islamic world, the poem is still relatively unfamiliar in the West. In this edition, the poet Raficq Abdulla has reinterpreted key extracts to make the wisdom of Sufism accessible to the contemporary reader. <br> Combining amusing anecdotes and satire with passages of great mystical beauty, the poem uses the birds journey to describe the stages of spiritual experience. From proud hawk to avaricious owl, the birds represent human archetypes with their own, very human, reasons for not setting out on the spiritual path. At the end of the tale, the birds discover that what they are seeking is nothing other than themselves: in Sufism, the way to God is inward and enlightenment is the passionate union of an individual soul with the Divine.<br> Richly illustrated with illuminations from Persian manuscripts, this is the only modern illustrated edition of The Conference of the Birds. Through his reworking of these important passages and his detailed introduction to the poem, Raficq Abdulla allows readers access to a mystical classic.</p><p>Like Rumi and Hafiz, the name Attar conjures up images of passionate attraction to the divine. Attar was a Persian Sufi of the 12th century and his masterpiece is <i>The Conference of the Birds</i>, an epic allegory of the seeker's journey to God. When all the birds of the world convene and determine that they lack a king, one bird steps forward and offers to lead them to a great and mighty monarch. Initially excited, each bird falters in turn, whereupon the leader admonishes them with well-targeted parables. These pithy tales are the delight of this 4,500-line poem, translated deftly into rhymed couplets. What is your excuse for not seeking God? Your life is fine already? You prefer material pleasure? You are holy enough? You have pride, lack courage, or are burdened with responsibility? Attar has an answer to encourage you on the path to the promised land. And when you get there, the king may not be what you'd expect, but you must make the journey to see. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Raficq Abdulla has written and presented numerous radio programs about Islam for the BBC, including a series of talks on the Prophet Muhammad and the Four Caliphs, and programs on the life and work of Jalaluddin Rumi. He has also written award-winning screenplays for Channel 4 in Britain, poetry and articles for a range of journals, and he is a frequent book reviewer. Raficq Abdulla describes himself as a secular Muslim and a lover of the arts, particularly music and poetry. He is the author of Words of Paradise, a collection of new interpretations of poems by Rumi and has gained popularity as an accomplished public speaker and performer of his own poetry.</p><h2>Craze: Gin and Debauchery in an Age of Reason</h2><p>In 1720, a new drink emerged as the overwhelming drug of choice among London's working poor; it was both affordable and many times stronger than traditional spirits. The beverage was gin, and the craze it initiated would become the 18th-century's equivalent of our crack cocaine epidemic. Craze is the first popular illustrated history to focus exclusively on the gin craze. Warner looks at the impact of "mother gin" from personal, political, and sexual perspectives. She draws on hundreds of primary sources, from Defoe to Dr. Johnson, guiding us through squalid back rooms, streets thronged with hawkers, raging mobs, and the halls of Parliament. The result is a timely, irreverent, utterly engrossing look at a city and a drug &#x2014; and a drug scare &#x2014; that helped shape our contemporary views of pleasure, consumption, and public morality.</p><p>"Gin was the opiate of the ordinary people, who were mostly illiterate, brutish and rude; the gin laws enacted by the ruling class were intended to keep the poor in their place . . . Thus the story of the gin craze takes on larger and more interesting implications than may at first be evident . . . Warner tells it well . . . Her prose is both lively and accessible, and she keeps the narrative moving along."<br> --Jonathan Yardley, THE WASHINGTON POST <p>"Warner evokes a vivid picture of 18th-century London, complete with its public hangings and slums that seemed to overflow with gin. She presents the fascinating cases of countless ordinary individuals who were affected by the craze, underscoring the power of the masses as each of the unpopular gin acts unraveled due to widespread disregard, if not outright protest."<br> --THE SEATTLE TIMES </p><p>"It is unwise to deprive Brits of their gin. But in the first half of the 18th century, as author Jessica Warner documents through newspapers and court records of the time, that is just what their government attempted to do. Her wonderfully written book . . . is a provocative parable for our own time . . . Warner . . . has written one of this year's most entertaining and timely books; it should be required reading for politicians and law enforcement officials."<br> --Paul Collins, THE PORTLAND OREGONIAN </p><p>"Entertainingly told . . . Warner writes with great flair, incorporating hundreds of quotes from letters, poems, newspaper stories, laws and police reports from the period . . . The book is organized into three acts, like an 18th-century play, complete with a list of characters and appropriate subtitles (&#x2018;In Which Virtue Triumphs Over Prudence&#x2019;). Warner is especially good at bringing to light the role of women in the gin craze."<br> --THE AUSTIN-AMERICAN STATESMAN </p><p>[Craze is] "an intoxicating concoction . . . Jessica Warner . . . is the sort of writer every university hack should want to be: learned, fluent, funny, scabrous and hardly ever didactic. She tells you a lot of stuff you knew little or nothing about before and makes it entirely relevant to the current situation. In this case, the war on gin as a social evil in 18th-century England is equated to the ongoing war on drugs. In doing so, Warner shines a bright light on a murky corner of history. She is a master of the telling detail, both in laying out the scope of the epidemic and in pointing out the absurdities of those who sought to curtail it. Warner has a particular genius for statistics and anecdotes that leave your jaw hanging."<br> --THE GLOBE AND MAIL (Toronto) </p><p>"Fascinating and revealing . . . Craze is a compact and tart summary of the gutter-dwelling characters and events that brought [gin] to the fetid alleys of London, Bristol and Norwich. . . . Warner may give the colourless spirit centre stage in Craze, but not only does she also come away with a colourful social history of urban 18th century England, but a lucid and devastating critique of the rusted moral chassis of the White House's failed war on drugs--frighteningly similar to the ill-conceived and equally vain attempts to curb the use of Mother Gin four centuries earlier. . . . After scouring volumes of journals and legal records from the period, Warner pieces together a brutal and backward city life in which no organized police force existed and the "rough discipline of the rabble" was often the only authority that mattered. . . . Her sharp and informed wit fills out the margins of court proceedings and news journal dispatches to bring such characters as black-market gin-monger Mary Bryan out of the footnotes and into the same rarefied arena as Walpole and Jekyll. She also skillfully takes just enough time to bring her more salacious vignettes to their proper end, such as the often dire fate of the informants who sent their neighbours to the house of correction, often on trumped up evidence. . . . Thoughtful social history . . ."<br> --THE TORONTO STAR </p><p>"Jessica Warner is not the first to write about the gin craze, but her book is easily the best on the subject. Unlike Patrick Dillon&#x2019;s soggy The Much-Lamented Death of Madame Geneva, which came out last year, Warner&#x2019;s book is acutely alive to the difficulty of reading the past through the concerns of the present. Thus while she feels impelled to make parallels between the public reaction to the gin craze and our own current, impotent flap about drug use, she anchors her arguments in precise, scholarly data and is always ready to point to the places where the analogies do not stand up. Added to this, she writes like an angel, which makes her as cheerily compelling as a nice G&amp;T at the end of a long, hard day."<br> --THE DAILY TELEGRAPH (London) </p><p>"Craze is not only about the 18th century's attempt to control street drugs. Much of what Warner says is directly or indirectly pertinent to similar efforts made by contemporary governments. Arguing with great skill and wit that drug abuse is a symptom and not the cause of social problems, she is persuasive and compelling to a surprising degree. Craze stirs us into action rather than allowing us to feel, as do many historical accounts or several glasses of gin, comfortably distanced from the grim reality of the situation."<br> --THE GUARDIAN (London)</p>&#x201c;Warner evokes a vivid picture of eighteenth-century London, complete with its public hangings and slums that seemed to overflow with gin.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>The Seattle Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Social history at its gimlet-eyed best.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i><br><br>&#x201c;[Jessica Warner&#x2019;s] prose is both lively and accessible, and she keeps the narrative moving along.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating...a crisp, detailed review of the history of the place and period.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Baltimore Sun</i></p><h2>The Seventh Day: A Novel</h2><p>From the acclaimed author of <i>Brothers</i> and <i>To Live:</i> a major new novel that limns the joys and sorrows of life in contemporary China.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yang Fei was born on a moving train. Lost by his mother, adopted by a young switchman, raised with simplicity and love, he is utterly unprepared for the tempestuous changes that await him and his country. As a young man, he searches for a place to belong in a nation that is ceaselessly reinventing itself, but he remains on the edges of society. At age forty-one, he meets an accidental and unceremonious death. Lacking the money for a burial plot, he must roam the afterworld aimlessly, without rest. Over the course of seven days, he encounters the souls of the people he&#x2019;s lost.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Yang Fei retraces the path of his life, we meet an extraordinary cast of characters: his adoptive father, his beautiful ex-wife, his neighbors who perished in the demolition of their homes. Traveling on, he sees that the afterworld encompasses all the casualties of today&#x2019;s China&#x2014;the organ sellers, the young suicides, the innocent convicts&#x2014;as well as the hope for a better life to come. Yang Fei&#x2019;s passage maps the contours of this vast nation&#x2014;its absurdities, its sorrows, and its soul. Vivid, urgent, and panoramic, <i>The Seventh Day</i> affirms Yu Hua&#x2019;s place as the standard-bearer of modern Chinese fiction.</p><p><b>Yu Hua</b> is the author of five novels, six story collections, and four essay collections. His work has been translated into more than twenty languages.

Yu Hua lives in Beijing.The fog was thick when I left my bedsit and ventured out alone into the barren and murky city. I was heading for what used to be called a crematorium and these days is known as a funeral parlor. I had received a notice instructing me to arrive by 9:00&nbsp;a.m., because my cremation was scheduled for 9:30.<br> &nbsp;<br> The night before had resounded with the sounds of collapsing masonry&#x2014;one huge crash after another, as though a whole line of buildings was too tired to stay standing and had to lie down. In this continual bedlam I drifted fitfully between sleep and wakefulness. At daybreak, when I opened the door, the din suddenly halted, as though just by opening the door I had turned off the switch that controlled the noise. On the door a slip had been posted next to the notices that had been taped there ten days earlier, asking me to pay the electricity and water bills. In characters damp and blurry in the fog, the new notice instructed me to proceed to the funeral parlor for cremation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fog had locked the city into a single, unchanging guise, erasing the boundaries between day and night, morning and evening. As I walked toward the bus stop, several human figures appeared out of nowhere, only to disappear just as quickly. I cautiously walked ahead for a distance, but found my passage blocked by some kind of sign that appeared to have suddenly grown out of the ground. I thought there ought to be some numbers on it&#x2014;if the number 203 was there, then this was the stop for the bus I wanted to take. But I couldn&#x2019;t make out the numbers, even when I felt for them with my hand. When I rubbed my eyes, I seemed to see the number 203, suggesting that this was indeed the stop. But now I had a strange feeling that while my right eye was in the original place, my left eye had moved outward to my cheekbone. Then I became aware that next to my nose a foreign object had attached itself to my face, and something else was caught underneath my chin. When I felt around with my hand, I discovered that my nose was next to my nose and my chin next to my chin&#x2014;somehow they had altered their locations.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fog was now even more dense. Amid the murky figures and ghostly buildings I heard sounds of life rising and falling like ripples of water. Then, as I took a few tentative steps farther on, hoping to penetrate the gloom, I heard cars crashing into each other. The fog had drenched my eyes and I couldn&#x2019;t see the collisions&#x2014;all I was aware of was a series of violent impacts. A car burst out of the fog behind me and sped past and into the sounds of life, and the sounds churned and popped like boiling water.<br> &nbsp;<br> I stood there uncertainly for a little while, but soon realized that if there was a pileup on this stretch of road, the No.&nbsp;203 bus would not arrive anytime soon and I should go on to the next stop.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I walked on ahead, snowflakes came billowing out of the fog. They seemed to glow like patches of light, and when they landed on my face, my skin felt slightly warmer. I stood still, watching the snowflakes fall through the air and settle on me. My clothes gradually stood out more clearly against the snow.<br> &nbsp;<br> This was an important day, I realized&#x2014;my first day of death. I hadn&#x2019;t washed and I hadn&#x2019;t dressed in funerary costume&#x2014;I was simply wearing my ordinary clothes, with a baggy old overcoat on top, as I headed toward the funeral parlor. Stricken with sudden misgivings at my sloppy attire, I turned on my heel and headed back in the direction from which I&#x2019;d come.<br> &nbsp;<br> The falling snow had brought some light to the city and the thick fog seemed to slowly dissipate as I walked, so that I could faintly make out pedestrians and vehicles going to and fro. As I reached the bus stop I had left shortly before, a scene of utter confusion met my eyes: the road was completely blocked by a chaotic tangle of over twenty vehicles, with police cars and ambulances ringing the perimeter. There were people lying on the ground and others being pulled from cars that were twisted completely out of shape; there were people moaning and people crying and people who made no sound at all. I stopped for a minute, and this time I could see clearly the number 203 on the sign. I made my way past.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I got back to my bedsit, I undressed, walked naked over to the shower enclosure, and turned on the faucet. As I filled my palms with water and began to wash, I found that my body was covered in wounds, and I gingerly removed the bits of gravel and splinters of wood that were embedded in the open lesions.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just then my mobile phone started to ring. I found this strange, because service had been disconnected two months earlier for nonpayment, and here suddenly it was ringing again. I picked it up and pressed the listen button. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; I said quietly.<br> &nbsp;<br> A voice responded. &#x201c;Is that Yang Fei?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Funeral parlor here. Where are you now?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m at home.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m washing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost nine o&#x2019;clock now! How can you still be washing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there soon.&#x201d; I felt embarrassed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hurry up, then, and be sure to bring your reservation slip.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where will I find that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be on your door.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Then the caller hung up. I wasn&#x2019;t very happy about this&#x2014;why was there such a rush? I put down the phone and renewed my efforts to clean my wounds. I picked up a bowl, filled it with water, and used it to wash out the remaining grit and splinters. This helped to speed things up.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still dripping wet, I walked over to the wardrobe and opened it, in search of a funerary costume. But I could find nothing answering this description; the closest thing was a pair of white silk pajamas with a low-key flower pattern and the characters, now faded, that Li Qing had embroidered in red thread on the chest&#x2014;a souvenir of my brief marriage. She had carefully chosen two pairs of traditional Chinese-style pajamas for us one day, and had sewn my name on hers and her name on mine. I had never worn these pajamas since our marriage broke up, but now, when I put them on once more, their color seemed as warm as that of snow.<br> &nbsp;<br> I opened the door and carefully studied the funeral parlor notice posted on the outside. On the slip was written A3&#x2014;a reservation number, by the look of it&#x2014;so I detached it, folded it carefully, and put it in my pajama pocket.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I was about to leave, I had the feeling I&#x2019;d forgotten something and stood for a moment in the swirling snow to ponder. Then I remembered&#x2014;a black armband. I was a single man, parentless and childless, with nobody to come and mourn my passing, so it was up to me to wear one.<br> &nbsp;<br> I went back into my room and riffled through the wardrobe for some black cloth. After a prolonged search all I could find was a black shirt so worn that it was now turning gray. I cut off part of the sleeve and placed it over my left arm. My mourning attire clearly left something to be desired, but I felt tolerably satisfied with the effect.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once more my phone rang. &#x201c;Is that Yang Fei?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, hello.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Funeral parlor here. Are you still planning to get cremated?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I hesitated for a moment. &#x201c;Yes, I am.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nine-thirty now&#x2014;you&#x2019;re late.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is it so important to be on time?&#x201d; I wanted to do things right.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If you want to get cremated, you need to hurry it up.&#x201d;</p><h2>Eagle&#39;s Gift</h2><p>Carlos Castaneda takes the reader into the very heart of sorcery, challenging both imagination and reason, shaking the very foundations of our belief in what is &#34;natural&#34; and &#34;logical.&#34; His landscape is full of terrors and mysterious forces, as sharply etched as a flash of lightning on the deserts and mountains where don Juan takes him to pursue the sorcerer&#39;s knowledge--the knowledge that it is the Eagle that gives us, at our births, a spark of awareness, that it expects to reclaim at the end of our lives and which the sorcerer, through his discipline, fights to retain.

Now everyone insists on telling her how to use them. Her grandmother says, ?Do it like me!? while she rapidly works her old wooden sticks with a ?click-clack-clicketing.? Her sister instructs, ?Be graceful like this!? as she crosses her pair ?back and forth, like legs, dancing.? But it's no use. No matter how hard Maggie practices to be like the others, they keep telling her she's doing it wrong! Frustrated, Maggie asks her cat, the Kitchen God and her ancestors what she should do. Finally, her father gently tells Maggie just what she needs to hear. ?Everyone is different. Everyone is unique,? he tells her. ?You hold your chopsticks perfectly.? <br><br>Author Alan Woo uses a poetic style to tell a timeless story about self-discovery and identity. It offers an inspiring message to young children about the importance of being true to yourself as you navigate the challenges of growing up. The rich illustrations by Isabelle Malenfant add depth to the spare text, capturing the family dynamics between the different personalities and beautifully portraying details of a traditional Chinese New Year gathering. This book is a wonderful resource for social studies lessons on world cultures, particularly on family traditions and celebrations. It makes a perfect read-aloud during classroom observances of Chinese New Year. A few Chinese words are included within the story, with translations and phonetic spellings provided in the front of the book.</p><p>Alan Woo's writing and poetry have appeared in Quills Canadian Poetry Magazine and Ricepaper magazine. Maggie's Chopsticks is his first children's book. Born in the Year of the Dragon, Alan lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, and sometimes likes to use a fork.<p>Isabelle Malenfant has illustrated more than a dozen children's books, garnering awards along the way. Maggie's Chopsticks is her first book with Kids Can Press. Isabelle first learned to use chopsticks when she was eight years old. She lives in Montreal, Quebec, with her family.</p>PreS-Gr 2-Maggie comes from a family of unique individuals, all with their own opinions and style, each one of them willing to give advice on how the child should hold her new chopsticks. Maggie listens to all of them in turn, weighing her options. Grandmother suggests using chopsticks in a rather forthright way, while Sister suggests a more graceful approach. As Maggie begins to worry that she may never find her own style, her father suggests that she be herself. Because of his encouragement, she is able to find just what works for her. Maggie comes from a traditional Chinese family, and she clearly wants to make them proud. Woo writes in a way that transforms a story about holding utensils into a poetic journey. Not only is Maggie learning the mechanics of chopsticks, but she is also learning to be herself. Language such as "click-clack-clicketing" and, as she circles her chopsticks above her fish tank, "the fish flee/from the wooden fingers/reaching through their sky of blue" makes children want to turn the page and find out what else Maggie will experience. In Malenfant's vibrant illustrations, deep reds and shimmering oranges leap from the pages. All children are fascinated with holding utensils, whether a fork, a spoon, or chopsticks, and are anxious to please adults while staking out their own individuality, making this a great choice for kids of all ethnic backgrounds.-Cass Mabbot, Seattle Public Library, WA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

This practical guide for beginners, in a handy sketchbook format, will show you how you can achieve attractive and successful paintings in just thirty minutes. Expert watercolourist, Fiona Peart, shares her tips and techniques for producing quick and effective paintings of beautiful flowers in half an hour; ideal for those short on time but high on enthusiasm!</p><p>Fiona Peart is a professional artist and fully qualified art tutor, specialising in watercolour and drawing techniques. She runs popular workshops, gives talks and presentations to various art groups, and also demonstrates at art shows and exhibitions throughout the UK. She writes regularly for The Artist, Leisure Painter and StartArt magazines, as well as contributing articles and features to national magazines, and has produced several DVDs on watercolour and coloured pencils. For more information visit www.fionapeart.comMay 13 In a fairly quiet issue for new books, I&#39;m going to kick off with this little volume because it&#39;s just such a good introduction to flower painting. Actually, scrub that, it&#39;s much more than an introduction and Fiona produces some stunning results that would be good however long they took. There&#39;s a huge number of styles of flower painting, from the carefully placed but relatively shapeless blob that gives depth and scale to a landscape through the informal flower portrait to the highly technical botanical illustration. And here we have something that falls in the middle of all those: flowers for their own sake-a riot of shapes and colours. The idea of the quick, timed painting isn&#39;t new and it&#39;s always a difficult one to get across in a book. After all, you cant be saying, &#34;are you still reading? Speed up dammit!&#34; This is part of a new series that addresses that problem. The first half of the book is devoted to a series of exercises that will loosen you up ad get you working confidently with your materials and the subject. we have Lifting and releasing the brush, Controlled shapes on dry paper as well as Lifting out and Dropping in. The while point of the quick work is that you think about the subject and not the mechanics and these exercises give you the tools to do that. The second stage is a series of ten projects, each presented in just four pages. So, not a lot of individual steps then, but if you&#39;re with me, you&#39;ll have understood why. I&#39;d maintain that you can&#39;t demonstrate a half-hour painting (except by doing it) but you can present an idea of how much can be achieved in the time. So, don&#39;t work through these sections slavishly. Read them, understand them, then put the book away and see how much you can achieve within the time limit. Can&#39;t do it all? Doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s not about a perfect result, it&#39;s about interpreting the subject, getting a flower that looks as though its just been picked, not hanging about for days. Want to extend your time to 45 minutes while you get the hang of it? Go on. I wont tell Fiona. I hope you can see that i&#39;m genuinley excited about this book. It&#39;s not just excellent on what it claims to do, though. It&#39;s an exciting way of painting flowers that actually goes a long way beyond the simple exercises it presents. * Paint * May 13 For those who don&#39;t have much time on their hands, but still like to paint, Fiona Peart shows you how to paint in 30 minutes. This book is part of a new 30 Minute Artist series from this publisher. Obviously, you will produce a more finished and polished piece of art if you have longer to spare. However, in limited time, it&#39;s amazing what can be achieved and it forces the artists to focus and to paint more freely and spontaneously. As a beginner, this book should boost your confidence because it shows you how easy it is to complete an acceptable painting. In this book Fiona concentrates on watercolour flowers. She offers expert tuition throughout the book through quick, lively studies from flowers in vases to studies. All your favourite flowers are probably included - lilies, iris, daffodils, tulips, roses and more. There are ten varied projects, each with step by step instructions. * Karen Platt Yarnsandfabrics.co.uk/crafts * June 13 Developed especially for the busy artist who wants to achieve great paintings in just half an hour, this new 30 Minute Artist series claims to do just that. Fiona&#39;s book includes tips and techniques offered on such subjects as lifting and releasing the brush, scraping and moving paint, controlling shapes on dry paper, using masking fluid, and backgrounds. Ten step-by-step projects follow, with clear and concise instruction. These books aim to build confidence in your chosen medium and subject so that you have the ability to paint effective paintings quickly. In time, this will help you to develop a loose style and keep your paintings lively. * Leisure Painter, The * April 13 Painting Flowers in Watercolour (Fiona Peart) and Painting Water in Watercolour (Terry Harrison) Half an hour is not a lot of time to paint a masterpiece, says Terry Harrison in his introduction. His advice on planning and preparing that follows is something that every artist should have tattooed on their forehead. The idea of a quick painting that captures the essence of your subject without fussing and fiddling is not a new one, but this series approaches it with simplified demonstrations that reflect the basis of the idea and offer some excellent hints and tips along the way. If I have an objection, Fiona Peart sums it up: &#39;Many of us do not have as much time as we would like to paint,&#39; but if filling the odd half-hour gets you past the time block, then buying these imaginative guides is money well spent. * Artist, The * Mar 13 This is a new series that Terry Harrison (whose idea it was) is justifiably proud of. There&#39;s nothing new in the limited-time idea and I have in the past criticised some of its implementations for pandering to the &#34;time-restricted artist&#34;. I&#39;m sorry, but art is something you devote time to. The whole point of it, of any recreation, is that it gives you a chance to relax and recharge. If you&#39;re that busy-busy-busy, you probably have a time-management issue that bish-bosh painting won&#39;t solve. But enough of that, because that&#39;s not the matter in hand. The proper use of the half-hour painting is to discourage fiddling and promote the skill of getting things down quickly, as you see them. It&#39;s about spontaneity and freshness, and therefore to be applauded. The structure here is really rather neat. The first half of the book is taken up with a series of exercises, Quick Techniques as they&#39;re described here. These are all about ways of seeing and thinking, but also about methods of working - rocks and waves or foliage and petals in a few quick brushstrokes. The idea is to suggest your subject rather than capture it in every minor detail. Following that is a series of projects that bring everything together. There&#39;s always a slight contradiction when you have printed demonstrations in a book that&#39;s supposed to be about spontaneity, but you have to describe the process somehow and these short (4 page) sections are very effective at showing you how to work within the time allowed. I suspect the best way of making this work is to read the chapter through and then work with it as just notes. If you don&#39;t head straight for home, but keep looking at the map, the oven-timer is going to ring while you&#39;re still getting the tops off the tubes! There&#39;s a nice busy feel to both these books that somehow encourages the whole idea they&#39;re trying to promote and, price-wise, they&#39;re a steal. * Artbookreview.net *</p><h2>Fail Safe</h2><p>Something has gone wrong. A group of American bombers armed with nuclear weapons is streaking past the fail-safe point, beyond recall, and no one knows why. Their destination -- Moscow. In a bomb shelter beneath the White House, the calm young president turns to his Russian translator and says, &#34;I think we are ready to talk to Premier Kruschchev.&#34; Not far away, in the War Room at the Pentagon, the secretary of defense and his aides watch with growing anxiety as the luminous blips crawl across a huge screen map.

Spanning the years 1907 to 1933, it offers a compelling eyewitness account of the rise of Hitler and Nazism.</p><p>What was it about Germany that made the rise of Adolf Hitler and his murderous regime possible? That troubling question has occupied many fine minds over the last six decades, few more lucid and thoughtful than the late historian and journalist Sebastian Haffner. In this book, drawn from a manuscript he did not live to complete, Haffner examines the social and cultural conditions that made Germany ill-equipped for democracy and ripe for totalitarianism. Among these, Haffner writes, were a generational war between an apathetic adult population and a youth "familiar with nothing but political clamor, sensation, anarchy, and the dangerous lure of irresponsible numbers games"; a fatal fondness for the winner-and-loser dichotomy of sports and a rage for spectacle and entertainment; a resignation through which ordinary people came to "adapt to living with clenched teeth, in a manner of speaking," rather than stand up in protest. In that climate, Haffner--who left Germany just before World War II broke out--suggests, Nazism was almost an inevitability, against which he, too, tried to withdraw into "a small, secure, private domain," like so many others of his time and place. An important eyewitness account, Haffner's book deepens our understanding of how small missteps can lead to tragic ends, and how nations can be led into chaos. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><p><strong>Sebastian Haffner </strong>(1938-1999) was born in Berlin.

She is also hiding secrets: the baby is not hers by birth, nor does she intend to stay. Rather, she desperately needs sanctuary from the child&#x2019;s violent father...<br><br>It surprises Anna how quickly her Amish habits return to her, and how satisfying it feels to reconnect with her friends and family. Even Anna&#x2019;s childhood friend Samuel, whose slow, thoughtful manner used to frustrate her, becomes a fond and reassuring companion.<br><br>But Anna hasn&#x2019;t fully faced the consequences of her irresponsible youth, and now, her mere presence may endanger the family she holds dear. If she wants to stay, she must seek forgiveness from the community whose blessing she took for granted, and experience the true change of heart required to make a new beginning.</p><p>A lifetime spent in rural Pennsylvania and her own Pennsylvania Dutch roots led <b>Marta Perry</b> to write about the Plain People who add to the rich heritage of her home state. She is the author of more than fifty inspirational romance novels, including the Pleasant Valley series and the Keepers of the Promise trilogy. She lives with her husband in a century-old farmhouse.Chapter One<br><br> She was beginning to fear that the prodigal daughter wouldn't make it home after all. Anna Beiler pressed on the gas pedal. "Come on, you can do it." The old car responded with nothing more than a shudder.<br><br> Daad would probably say that this was what she got for depending on something so English as a car to get her home, and maybe he'd be right. Just the thought of seeing her father made her stomach queasy. How would he, how would any of the family, react to Anna's turning up at her Amish home three years after she'd given up all they believed in to disappear into the English world?<br><br> The car gave an ominous sputter. It might be her prized possession, but she didn't know much about its inner workings. Still, that noise and the shaking couldn't be good signs.<br><br> She gripped the steering wheel tighter, biting her lip, and faced the truth. She wasn't going to make it to the Beiler farm, the place where she'd been born, the place she'd left in rebellion and disgrace. She'd been almost nineteen then, sure she knew all about the world. Now, at twenty-two, she felt a decade older than the girl she'd been.<br><br> But there, just ahead, she spotted the turnoff to Mill Race Road. Two miles down Mill Race was the home of her brother and sister-in-law. Joseph and Myra would welcome her, wouldn't they?<br><br> Forced into a decision, she'd have to take that chance. She turned onto the narrow road, earning another protesting groan from the car. Her fingers tensed so much that she'd have to peel them from the steering wheel. Worse, now that she was so close, all the arguments for and against coming here pummeled her mind.<br><br> Was this the right choice? Her stomach clenched again. She didn't know. She just knew returning was her only option.<br><br> It was strange that things looked the same after three years. Pleasant Valley, Pennsylvania, didn't change, or at least not quickly. Maybe there'd been a little more traffic on the main road, but now that she was off that, not a car was in sight.<br><br> The fields on either side of the road overflowed with pumpkins, cabbage, and field corn that had yet to be cut. Neat barns and silos, farmhouse gardens filled with chrysanthemums, sumac topped with the dark red plumes that made them look like flaming torches-this was September in Pennsylvania Dutch country, and she was coming home.<br><br> Maybe she should have written, but when had there been time? There'd been no time for anything but to get out of Chicago as quickly as possible. And there was no way she could explain the unexplainable.<br><br> She glanced into the backseat, and her heart expanded with love. Gracie slept in her car seat, good as gold, just as she'd been throughout the long trip. At not quite a year old, she could hardly have understood her mother's fear, but she'd cooperated.<br><br> The neat white sign for Joseph's machine shop stood where it always had. Anna turned into the narrow gravel lane, determination settling over her. It was far too late to worry if her decision would work. She had to make it work, for Gracie's sake.<br><br> Joseph and Myra's place was a hundred-year-old white frame farmhouse, identifiable as Amish only by the fact that no electric lines ran to the house. They owned only a few acres, not enough to farm but plenty for the machine shop that her mechanically minded brother ran.<br><br> In the pasture to the right of the lane a bay horse lifted his head, eyeing her curiously, probably wondering what a car was doing here. Tossing his mane, he trotted a few feet beside her along the fence.<br><br> If Gracie were awake, she would point out the horsey, something that up until now Gracie had seen only in her picture books. Everything about this place would be strange and new to her.<br><br> Not to Anna. For her, it all had an almost heartless familiarity. The very sameness made it seem to her that Pleasant Valley had gotten along quite nicely without her, thank you very much, and could continue to do so.<br><br> Joseph's shop was in the large outbuilding at the end of the lane, while off to the left beyond it stood the horse barn. Surely there'd be room in one of them to store the car.<br><br> Get it out of sight-that was all she could think. Get the car out of sight, and then they'd be safe.<br><br> Maybe she ought to drive straight to the shop. She could park behind it, if nothing else. As if it had read her mind, the car gave one last sputter, a cough, and died, just short of the house.<br><br> "No, don't do this," she muttered. She switched the key off and then turned it on again, touching the gas pedal gently.<br><br> Nothing. The car seemed to sink down on its wheels, like a horse sagging into clean straw after a hard day's work.<br><br> She pounded the steering wheel with the heel of her hand. Still, at least she was here. Joseph would help her, wouldn't he? He'd always had a tender spot for his baby sister.<br><br> Mindful that Gracie still slept, Anna slid out of the car, leaving the door open for air, and straightened, groaning a little. Her muscles protested after all those hours in the car, to say nothing of the tension that had ridden with her.<br><br> She glanced down at the faded blue jeans, sneakers, and wrinkled shirt she wore. It might be less harrowing for Joseph and Myra if she'd arrived in conventional Amish clothes, but she'd certainly have drawn attention to herself driving a car that way.<br><br> Not giving herself time to think about their reaction, she walked quickly to the back door.<br><br> She knocked on the screen door, paused, and then knocked again, louder. Nothing. The inner door was closed-odd on a pleasant September day. She opened the screen door, tried the knob, and the realization seeped into her. The luck that had gotten her all the way here from Chicago had run out. No one was home.<br><br> She stood on the back step, biting her lip, frowning at the car. The dark blue compact, liberally streaked with rust, had been her friend Jannie's, and now it was hers, the only car she'd ever owned. Pete knew it well, too well. If he'd followed her-<br><br> That was ridiculous. Pete couldn't possibly have known where she was going. She had to stop jumping at shadows.<br><br> But her common sense seemed to have fled. All she could think was to get the car out of sight and submerge herself and Gracie in the protective camouflage of the Amish community as quickly as possible.<br><br> Joseph and Myra were away, but one of their horses might still be in the barn. If she could hitch it to the car, she could tow the vehicle out of sight. Hurrying, she checked the sleeping baby. Gracie still slept soundly, her head turned to one side in the car seat, a small hand unfurling like a leaf next to her face.<br><br> Gracie was all right. She just had to keep her that way. Anna turned and jogged toward the barn, urged on by the fear that had pursued her all the way from Chicago.<br><br> She slid the heavy door open and blinked at the dimness, inhaling the familiar scents of fresh straw, hay, and animals. From one of the stalls came a soft snort and the thud of hooves as the animal moved. Thank heaven. If the horse had been turned out in the field for the day, she might never have caught it.<br><br> The bay mare came willingly to her, nosing over the stall boards. It was Myra's buggy horse, most likely. Wherever they were today, they'd taken the one Joseph drove. Did he still have that big roan?<br><br> Lifting a lead line from the hook, Anna started to open the stall door.<br><br> A board creaked behind her, and she whirled toward the sound, her breath catching.<br><br> "What are you doing with that horse?"<br><br> A man stood in the open doorway, silhouetted against the light behind him. Not Joseph, for sure, but Amish, to judge by the outline of him and the cadence of the words he'd spoken in English.<br><br> Well, of course he'd spoken English. That was what he thought she was, standing there in her jeans and T-shirt-an English woman. A horse thief, maybe.<br><br> He moved toward her before she could find the words for an explanation, and she could see him better. Could recognize him.<br><br> "It's . . . Samuel Fisher, ain't so?" The Amish phrase she hadn't used in three years came readily to her lips. Samuel was her sister-in-law Myra's brother. Maybe Joseph and Myra had asked him to look after things while they were gone today.<br><br> He stopped a few feet from her, assessing her with a slow, steady gaze. Slow, she thought. Yes, that was Samuel. Maybe deliberate would be a kinder word. Samuel had never been one to rush into anything.<br><br> "So. Anna Beiler. You've come home, then."<br><br> He'd switched to Pennsylvania Dutch, and it took her a moment to make the mental change. After so much time away, she even thought in English.<br><br> "As you can see."<br><br> "It's been a long time."<br><br> "Three years." She shifted her weight impatiently from one foot to the other. She didn't have time to stand here chatting with Samuel. The baby could wake-someone could spot the car. "Do you know where Joseph and Myra are?"<br><br> He took his time about the answer, seeming to register every detail of her appearance as he did. "They've gone over to Fostertown for the day. Joseph didn't say anything to me about you coming."<br><br> "Why should he?" The words snapped out before she could moderate them.<br><br> Samuel's strong, stolid face didn't register much change-but then, it never had. His already-square jaw might have gotten a little squarer, his hazel eyes might have turned a bit cold, but that was all.<br><br> As for the rest-black suspenders crossed strong shoulders over a light blue work shirt, and a summer straw hat sat squarely on sun-streaked brown hair. He seemed taller and broader than he had when she'd last seen him. Well, they were both older. He'd be twenty-six, now, the same as Joseph.<br><br> "Joseph and I are partners in the business, besides him being my brother-in-law," Samuel said, voice mild. "Usually he tells me if he expects somebody, 'specially if he's going to be away."<br><br> "Sorry," she muttered. "I didn't mean to be rude. Joseph didn't know I was coming."<br><br> "Ja, I see. And you thought you'd take Betsy to go and look for them?"<br><br> "No, of course not." Her fingers tightened on the lead rope. "Look, Samuel, I need . . ." How to explain? There wasn't any way. "I need to put my car in the barn or the shop, but the engine died. I thought I could pull it with Betsy. Will you help me?"<br><br> He kept her waiting again, studying her with that unhurried stare. Her nerves twitched.<br><br> "Well?" she demanded.<br><br> Samuel's firm mouth softened in a slow grin. "I see you're as impatient as ever, Anna Beiler. Ja, I will help you." He took the rope from her, his callused fingers brushing hers. "But I wish I knew what you are up to, I do."<br><br> She stepped out of his way as he opened the stall door, talking softly to the animal. He didn't seem to expect any answer to his comment, and she couldn't give one.<br><br> What could she say? She could hardly tell him that she'd come home because she had no place else to go-and that she was only staying as long as she had to. Little though she wanted to deceive anyone, she had no choice. Gracie's future depended on it.<br><br> Samuel looped the lead rope through the ring in the upright and went to get the harness. The deliberate movements gave him a few moments to consider. Was he doing as Joseph would want?<br><br> Well, Joseph might not be happy to have a car stowed in his barn, but he would be wonderful glad to see his little sister home again. Samuel knew him well enough to be sure of that.<br><br> He lifted the harness from its rack and carried it to where the mare stood patiently waiting. Anna was not quite so patient, moving back and forth like a nervous animal pacing in its stall.<br><br> "I'll harness her up and use a chain to attach her to the car. That should be plenty gut enough to move it, long as we're not going uphill."<br><br> She caught the harness strap on the other side of the mare as Samuel tossed it over, pulling it into place. "Where should we take the car, do you think? The barn or the shop?"<br><br> He considered. "Joseph might not want it in the shop, where people are in and out every day. Let's put it in the back of the barn for now."<br><br> If she was home to stay, she'd be getting rid of the car first thing, he supposed, so what difference did it make? When he'd first spotted the car, and then seen the woman going into the barn, he'd thought it was someone looking for the English couple who lived down the road. Anna Beiler had never entered his mind.<br><br> Anna ran her hand down the mare's shoulder, crooning to her, and then reached underneath to fasten a strap.<br><br> "Seems like you remember how to do this," he said. "I thought you might have forgotten, after living as an Englischer so long."<br><br> "It's coming back to me." Her voice was dry and clipped, all her softness saved for the animal.<br><br> Anna had changed, no doubt about that. Those jeans and shirt didn't leave a lot to the imagination. She'd always been slim, but now she was almost skinny.<br><br> The blond hair he'd always seen braided neatly back under her prayer covering was now pulled into an untidy knot at the back of her neck. Her slim shoulders were stiff, as if she couldn't let herself relax.<br><br> The strain showed in her face, too, in small lines around her blue eyes and in the tight way she held her mouth. He remembered a rosy face always alive with feeling-either passionately happy or sad or angry. Anna had never done anything by halves. She'd always felt everything more intensely, it had seemed, than anyone else.<br><br> Now- Well, she looked as if the outside world had knocked all that youthful spirit out of her. The English world could do that. His own experience had taught him well.</p><h2>Christ&#39;s Way to Pray: How Christ Prays With Us and For Us</h2><p>Do your prayers seem to bounce off the wall and back into your face? Do you feel as if your petitions barely reach the ceiling before falling back shattered at your feet? How can your puny prayers become prevailing prayers? Christ&#39;s Way to Pray explains that the answer is not found in focusing on our prayers or the prayers of others. The real answer is found in joining our weak prayers with Christ&#39;s mighty prayers, the Christ who passionately and perpetually prays for us and with us.</p><p></p><h2>Historical Paradors: A Journey Through Spanish Hotels</h2><p>Dust jacket notes: &#34;In this book, Spain is presented to us through a tour of its most beautiful Paradors, important and historical buildings turned into exclusive hotels.

A series of young men had come and gone from the farm over the years, all seeming to vanish into thin air. Now LaBarre was on the run. Eventually she would be caught and would plead insanity. But was she indeed insane &#x2014; an "avenging angel sent to kill pedophiles," as she claimed &#x2014; or a vicious, calculating serial killer? <i>Wicked Intentions</i> explores the case in depth, from investigation to trial. As the Emmy award-winning television reporter who first broke the story of the Sheila LaBarre murders, Kevin Flynn is uniquely positioned to unveil the details of the bizarre chain of events that culminated in one of America's most sensational murder stories &#x2014; a spellbinding true story of obsession and vigilantism carried to a deadly extreme.</p><p></p><h2>Supernanny: How to Get the Best From Your Children</h2><p><strong>Meet <em>Supernanny</em></strong> Jo Frost, a modern-day Mary Poppins here to rescue today's beleaguered parents by offering up her practical, road-tested methods of childrearing in an indispensable new book based on her upcoming ABC-TV series. <p>Jo Frost, a.k.a. Supernanny, is the answer to every stressed-out parent's dreams. In ABC's upcoming primetime TV series by the same name, Jo works miracles on problem children by dispensing hard-won wisdom and reassuring us that parents really do know best. The Supernanny method gives parents the know-how to tackle problem areas such as mealtime, bath time, bedtime, bedwetting, homework, sibling rivalry, aggressive behavior, or a child who just won't do what he or she is told to do. </p><p>Divided into action-oriented problem and solution sections, Supernanny will show parents how to restore harmony and authority in the home using the Supernanny's ten basic rules and her effective, no-nonsense approach to problem-solving. For example: </p><p><strong>Problem: What if your child refuses to go to bed?</strong> <strong>Supernanny Solution:</strong> Develop a bedtime routine so that the child can get used to a consistent pattern that she is not going to be able to change or manipulate. A routine will set up a calming sequence of events that will be designed to help the child relax. </p><p><strong>Problem: Toilet-training Supernanny Solution:</strong> Prepare your child by taking any hint of shame or disgust out of what is simply a natural fact of life. Keep the door open, bring her into the bathroom with you, and explain what's happening, including the use of toilet paper and the washing of hands afterward. </p></p><p>For despairing moms and dads everywhere, "Supernanny" Jo Frost may as well be wearing a Wonder Woman costume. Her no-nonsense rules--not tips, not advice, but <i>rules</i>--for consistently managing one's offspring leave no room for arguments (or wrestling matches). From her arms-akimbo stance on the book's cover, it's clear she's in charge, and ready to instruct all wishy-washy (overworked American) parents how to lay down the law in their own home. She offers her "top ten rules" for setting boundaries, managing mealtimes, even surviving toilet training, and it's mostly rock-solid, and peppered liberally with British wit. (For parents who obsess over their toddler's every meal, she warns: "It doesn't take long for them to work out the obvious: <i>you can't make them eat</i>.") Frost may not have a degree in child development, but she was raised in a stable, doting family, and has 15 years' experience taking care of tots, a combination which puts her way ahead of most parents. She may be firm, but by setting definite boundaries, she sets the stage for parenting to be more of a "joy" and much less of a "slog." You can raise your sippy cups to that. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i><strong>Jo Frost</strong> has had over fifteen years' experience as a nanny to children from newborns to teens, on both sides of the Atlantic. Her TV series,<em>Supernanny,</em> was a huge hit in the UK and in the States on ABC primetime.

Yarbro returns to her heroic vampire in 438 C.E., when he was known as Dom Feranescus Rakoczy Sanctu-Germainios, Regional Guard of Apulum Inferior. Series fans will welcome the reappearance of Atta Olivia Clemens, the count's former lover, but she soon departs the Carpathians for Constantinople. More compelling is Nicoris, an attractive refugee whom Rakoczy meets en route to Sanctu-Eustachios, a hermit monastery where slaves, soldiers and refugees hope to survive the impending Hun attack. Nicoris quickly falls under Rakoczy's spell, fascinated by the revelation of his true nature, but she has a dangerous secret that may spell doom for their future. Yarbro's impeccable research enhances but doesn't distract from the romance, which is diminished only by the sad, too-brief epilogue. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nancy Kress, an award-winning author of novels, short stories, and columns on writing, has created another thoughtful but dramatic statement on social issues. <p> Leisha Camden was genetically modified at birth to require no sleep, and her normal twin Alice is the control. Problems and envy between the sisters mirror those in the larger world, as society struggles to adjust to a growing pool of people who not only have 30 percent more time to work and study than normal humans, but are also highly intelligent and in perfect health. The Sleepless gradually outgrow their welcome on Earth, and their children escape to an orbiting space station to set up their own society.

Remember: just because it's true, doesn't mean it's boring!</p> <p> <strong>Exclusive: Amazonian Tips for Amazon.com</strong> </p><p> </p><p>When you think of the word &#x201c;Amazon,&#x201d; we&#x2019;re sure the first thing that comes to mind is the fantastic website where you can buy our book (buy our book!) or half-naked warrior women. But here are three tantalizing tidbits you might not know--and why you need to act now.</p> <p><b>1. Find Gold</b><br> There&#x2019;s something about long, tropical rivers that seems to drive people batty. But the Basque conquistador Lope de Aguirre was by all accounts a murderous sociopath long before he got to the Amazon. Take, for instance, the time a judge sentenced Aguirre to be flogged. The brutish Basque hunted the terrified magistrate across 4,000 miles of rough South American terrain, barefoot, to kill him! So, in 1560, it probably wasn&#x2019;t the best idea to invite Aguirre along on the quest to find El Dorado, the legendary city of gold. After 900 miles of unbroken rain forest, Aguirre was fed up. He led a mutiny that killed more than half of his fellow conquistadors. Then, he declared himself prince of Peru, Tierra Firma, and Chile. Eventually he and his tiny army attacked Panama...where he was killed and dismembered so his body parts could be paraded around the colony. <br> <b>The bright side:</b> El Dorado is still out there, waiting for you to discover it! Just don&#x2019;t bring a friend like Lope.</p> <p><b>2. Invest a Dollar</b><br> When it&#x2019;s not making people crazy, the Amazon seems to inspire bizarre, larger-than-life schemes. In 1967, American shipping magnate and billionaire Daniel Ludwig bought a larger-than-Connecticut sized chunk of the Amazon to create a gigantic industrial and agricultural complex called the Jari Project. It didn&#x2019;t work out. All the construction led to massive soil erosion, screwing up the &#x201c;agricultural&#x201d; part of his plan. After sinking $1 billion into the project (back when $1 billion really meant something) Ludwig called it quits in 1982. It was eventually put up for sale for $1--a great deal, if you&#x2019;re willing to assume $354 million in debt. <br> <b>The bright side:</b> For anyone with a dollar and a dream, it&#x2019;s your lucky day: the Jari Project is still for sale!</p> <p><b>3. Make New Friends</b><br> The pictures of spear-wielding tribesmen produced in May 2008 may have been a hoax, but it&#x2019;s true that there are literally dozens of so-called &#x201c;uncontacted&#x201d; native tribes in the Amazon basin--Stone Age peoples who have never had any contact with the outside world! While this seems preposterous, it makes sense when you consider the Basin&#x2019;s size, over 2.7 million square miles in area, half of which is covered by dense rain forest and divided by 15,000 rivers and tributaries. Altogether, there are believed to be about three dozen uncontacted tribes in Brazil and 15 in Peru.<br> <b>The bright side:</b> If you&#x2019;re up for the adventure, you have more than 50 chances to claim fame and fortune. Just make sure you don&#x2019;t accidentally give everyone smallpox.</p> <p><b>... And so much more!</b><br> What you&#x2019;ve just read isn&#x2019;t available in our book, but don&#x2019;t worry--roughly 82% of the rest of history is. Our twelve essential chapters tackle everything from civilization&#x2019;s baby steps in the Fertile Crescent to the Pope&#x2019;s first text message, the 6,000-pound super-wombats of early Australia to the Goose Crusade of 1096, the golden hemorrhoids of the Philistines to the most important assassinations of the 20th century, and everything else that&#x2019;s wacky, entertaining, and completely, unbelievably true.</p><p>Erik Sass is a journalist based in Los Angeles with branch offices around the country. When not writing for mental_floss, he reports on the media and advertising business for MediaPost.com. </p><br><br><p>An award-winning political journalist and history writer for more than three decades, Steve Wiegand has worked as a reporter and columnist for the <em>San Diego Evening Tribune</em>, the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, and the <em>Sacramento Bee</em>, where he currently covers state government and politics.</p><p>During his career, he has interviewed four presidents and six California governors&#x2014;and has the dubious distinction of once being airsick and throwing up on the shoes of the state attorney general's wife.</p><p>It may have been his greatest personal contribution to world history.</p><p>Wiegand is a graduate of Santa Clara University, where he majored in American literature and U.S. history. He also holds a Master of Science degree in Mass Communications from California State University, San Jose.</p><p>In addition to <em>The mental_floss History of the World</em>, Wiegand is the author of <em>U.S. History for Dummies</em>, <em>Sacramento Tapestry</em>, and <em>Papers of Permanence</em>, a contributing author to <em>mental_floss presents: Forbidden Knowledge</em>, and a frequent contributor to <em>mental_floss</em> magazine.</p><p>He lives in Northern California.</p><br><br><p>Will Pearson and Mangesh Hattikudur met as first year students at Duke University.

Sensational in its revelations; at the same time, a biography of unassailable integrity. I could not put it down.'' --Gregory Peck</p><h2>Constance: Poems</h2><p>Poems deal with depression and the grief brought about by the sickness and death of loved ones</p><p><b>Jane Kenyon</b> is the author of <i>Otherwise: New and Selected Poems</i> and <i>A Hundred White Daffodils</i>. She lived with her husband, Donald Hall, in Wilmot, New Hampshire, until her death in 1995.The cumulative effect of these quiet, unassuming poems lingers long after this slim volume is closed. Kenyon's ( Let Evening Come ) fourth collection is built around two perfectly orchestrated poem sequences. In the first, the speaker contrasts memories of her baby carriage with other images from her childhood, such as her parents' toiling away at low-paying jobs. She also recalls the present-day life of her aging, increasingly dependent mother. Melancholia, the subject of the second sequence and several poems surrounding it, has been played to death in modern poetry, but still Kenyon offers new insights and gives even the most depressing poems an uplifting lilt in their final lines. In her hands a list of the latest medications becomes fit material for poetry: "The coated ones smell sweet or have / no smell; the powdery ones smell / like the chemistry lab at school / that made me hold my breath." She writes, in addition to illness, of sleep, insomnia and death. She interacts with the insects, birds and flowers in her New Hampshire landscape, relying on their fragility to teach her of her own. Kenyon describes afterlife, or "the Other Side," with the same precise, hard-edged imagery that fills her other poems. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>This Was Railroading</h2><p>An Historical Collection Of Rare Photos And True Stories About The Tracks, Trains And Trainmen Of The Pacific Northwest, Including Northern California.</p><p></p><h2>Everyday Chinese Cooking: Quick and Delicious Recipes from the Leeann Chin Restaurants</h2><p>"There are too many exotic ingredients." . . .

From conception and composition to arrangement and production, the ways in which <i>Pet Sounds</i> changed the face of American popular music are chronicled. While <i>Pet Sounds</i> carries the tag of being a Beach Boys record, this lively expos� reveals just how little input the rest of the band had in its recording. Illustrating Brian Wilson's prodigious talent, the book chronicles his ability to turn his back on the protest songs and folk-rock of his contemporaries, and even on the bright surf sound of his own creation, in order to reach deep within himself to make music that struck an emotional chord and touched people&#x2019;s souls. Wilson&#x2019;s ability to embrace the rapidly advancing recording technology of the 1960s and to expertly blend rock 'n' roll, rhythm and blues, and jazz sounds with velvety harmonies and sensitive melodies to create a brand-new studio sound are discussed. An intimate portrait of Wilson&#x2019;s family, breakdown, and drug use is included."</p><p><b>Charles L. Granata</b> is a record producer, music historian, and the author of the award-winning <i>Sessions with Sinatra: Frank Sinatra and the Art of Recording</i>. He lives in Livingston, New Jersey. <b>Tony Asher</b> is a lyricist who collaborated with Brian Wilson on <i>Pet Sounds</i>. He lives in Los Angeles.In 1965, Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys released a revolutionary rock album that would influence the Beatles' Rubber Soul as well as the music of the Who, Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones. As music historian Granata points out in this often passionate, sometimes pedantic history of Pet Sounds, U.S. audiences turned a cold shoulder to this album because it represented such a departure from the pleasing surf melodies that had made the Beach Boys famous. In spite of such a reception, the album showcases the soaring musical genius of Wilson, argues Granata, in what was perhaps truly the first ever "concept album." The innovative combination of folk, blues and jazz blended into the gorgeous harmonies of the Beach Boys. Granata traces the evolution of the album from its writing, mostly by Wilson and Tony Asher, to the long nights of production in the studio. He analyzes dispassionately each song on the album, from the jangly 12-string guitar chords of "Wouldn't It Be Nice?," which open the album, to the closing harmonies of "Caroline, No" that close it. Granata chronicles Wilson's well-known disappearance from the musical scene not long after the album's release to battle the demons of paranoid schizophrenia, as well as his recent solo appearances performing the songs from Pet Sounds. Granata devotedly tells a story whose contours are already well known, so the book at times appears to be a set of liner notes allowed to grow too large. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Split Seconds: A Remembrance (English and German Edition)</h2><p>The foremost singer-interpreter of Schubert&#39;s lieder analyzes the songs within the context of the composer&#39;s life and environment</p><p></p><h2>Christmas Eve at Friday Harbor: A Novel (Friday Harbor, 1)</h2><p><p>One rain-slicked night, six-year-old Holly lost the only parent she knew, her beloved mother Victoria.

Throughout her life Moore arranged and rearranged, visited and revisited, a large majority of her existing poetry, always adding new work interspersed among revised poems. This makes sorting out the complex textual history that she left behind a pressing task if we mean to represent her work as a poet in a way that gives us a complete picture. <i>New Collected Poems </i>offers an answer to the question of how to represent the work of a poet so skillful and singular, giving a portrait of the range of her voice and of the modernist culture she helped create.</p><p>William Carlos Williams, remarking on the impeccable precision of Moore&#x2019;s poems, praised &#x201c;the aesthetic pleasure engendered when pure craftsmanship joins hard surfaces skillfully.&#x201d; It is only in <i>New Collected Poems</i> that we can understand her later achievements, see how she refashioned her earlier work, and get a more complete understanding of her consummate craftsmanship, innovation, and attention to detail. Presented and collected by Heather Cass White, the foremost scholar of Moore&#x2019;s work, this new collection at last allows readers to experience the untamed force of these dazzling poems as the author first envisioned them.</p></p><p><p><b>Marianne Moore</b> (1887&#x2013;1972) was an American poet, critic, editor, and translator, greatly admired for her formal innovations and startling vision. Her poetry received many honors, including the Dial Award, the National Book Award, the Pulitzer Prize, and the Bollingen Prize. Her poetry books include <i>Observations</i> and <i>New Collected Poems</i>.</p><p><b>Heather Cass White</b> has edited two previous collections of Marianne Moore&#x2019;s poetry, <i>A-Quiver with Significance: Marianne </i><i>Moore, 1932&#x2013;1936</i> (2008), and <i>Adversity &amp; Grace: </i><i>Marianne Moore, 1936&#x2013;1941</i> (2012). She is Professor of English at the University of Alabama.</p><p>"A fresh perspective on the legacy of Marianne Moore . . . In this new volume, White, a professor at the University of Alabama, presents what she believes to be the best version of Moore's work, along with copious notes, and various versions of poems that Moore tinkered with over years or even decades. Readers and writers will benefit from seeing how Moore . . . drastically cut some of her most famous poems . . . With this book, White has not only given readers an authoritative compendium of Moore's work but an insightful critique of her writing process." &#x2015;Elizabeth Lund<i>, The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Marianne Moore&#x2019;s poems strike me] as miracles of language and construction. Why had no one ever written about things in this clear and dazzling way before?&#x201d;&#x2015;Elizabeth Bishop</p><p>&#x201c;Heather Cass White has given us what must be the definitive edition of Marianne Moore, a poet unique enough to be celebrated by Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams. Her influence on such superb artists as Richard Wilbur, Elizabeth Bishop, and May Swenson testifies to her importance. More than ever, as barbarism threatens to flood us, we need the vital poets of our beleaguered nation.&#x201d; &#x2015;Harold Bloom </p><p>&#x201c;With graceful ingenuity, Heather Cass White enables for the reader an often disparate (though always essential) art, by providing illuminating commentary from both Marianne Moore and herself. W. H.Auden best describes the consequence: &#x2018;One of the few modern poets whom I can read on any day and in any mood.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2015;Richard Howard</p><p>&#x201c;Heather Cass White challenges Marianne Moore&#x2019;s retrospective editorial control of her poems in order to present Moore&#x2019;s work as her contemporaries would have encountered it. In so doing White deepens our access to Moore&#x2019;s brilliance and idiosyncrasy while also expanding our sense of her work&#x2019;s relation to its historical moment. This does not supplant Moore&#x2019;s own editing but illuminates it. This does not end conversation about Moore&#x2019;s indispensable poetry; it revitalizes it.&#x201d; &#x2015;Ben Lerner</p><p>&#x201c;<i>New Collected Poems</i> is a wonderful gift to readers of Marianne Moore&#x2015;there are versions of poems here that few of us have seen before&#x2015;and it is sure to win new readers, too, of one of the brave originals of modern writing. Heather Cass White has edited these poems with a generous intelligence, and the notes and apparatus are exemplary for their tact.&#x201d; &#x2015;David Bromwich</p><p>&#x201c;Heather Cass White has restored to us a Marianne Moore whom Moore herself partly abjured. Like Whitman, like Lowell, Moore was a notable and complex reviser of her earlier work. Just as many of us cherish the 1855 <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, Moore&#x2019;s contemporaries prized the earlier versions of her stunning poems. Moore the editor may have betrayed Moore the earlier poet; certainly successive editions have obscured her first brilliances and the striking development of her work. A bold, brave, scrupulous and beautiful book, <i>New Collected Poems</i> give us Moore&#x2019;s poems in their fullest first-published versions while also alerting us to their later permutations. Controversial this may be; a rigorous wonder it surely is. Moore&#x2019;s poems shimmer in their sharp singularities&#x2015;they are as fresh and freshening now as they were decades ago. This incomparable poet finally has the edition she deserves. Moore&#x2019;s modernism is unobsolete. We have yet to take her measure, though she surely took ours. Her poems are, as Mandelstam wrote of Dante, &#x2018;missiles for capturing the future.&#x2019; Blast off!&#x201d; &#x2015;Maureen N. McLane</p><p>"More Marianne Moore is always a delight. Maximal Moore, which is what Heather Cass White's gives us in this truly complete edition of the poems, is heaven. Over the years, and to the puzzlement of her readers, Moore rethought and altered already published work. This book lets us follow the track of the changes of mind of one of the finest poetic minds of the 20th century, diamond-sharp, ocean-deep." &#x2015;Holland Cotter</p></p><h2>A Texas Sky (Yellow Rose Trilogy, Book 2)</h2><p><p><i>A Texas Sky </i>delivers the vibrant characters and heartwarming romance that keep 2,000,000 readers burning the midnight oil with each new release.

Along the way, Rambam's Ladder will help all of us make our lives, and the lives of those around us, better.</p><p>How do we become better people? Through helping others. Nearly a thousand years ago the Jewish philosopher and physician Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, known to the Greeks as Maimonides and to Hebrew scholars as Rambam, gave much thought to righteousness. Out of his philosophical exploration came what is known as the Ladder of Charity, an elegantly simple half-page of wisdom spelling out the eight steps of giving. Written with compassion and common sense, the rules are as vital today as they were in the 12th century.Julie Salamon, the bestselling author and <i>New York Times</i> culture writer, makes the 1,000-year-old wisdom come alive in <i>Rambam's Ladder</i>, a short, inspirational book that motivates every reader to get a toehold on the ladder and start climbing, from the bottom rung--To give begrudgingly, as we often will to a panhandler--to the top, where the gift is such that the receiver becomes self-reliant. In eight chapters, one for each rung, the book helps us navigate the world of giving. How much to give? How do we know if our gifts are being used wisely?Is it better to give anonymously? If giving overly benefits the giver, is it somehow corrupt? And it reminds us of the deep vein of charity and goodness that runs through America. With interviews of foundation presidents and small-business owners, multi-millionaires and the homeless who poured out of a Bowery shelter on 9/11 to help straggling survivors, <i>Rambam's Ladder</i> is an uplifting book with a timeless message: give better, and live better.Julie Salamon, a culture writer and critic for The New York Times since May 2000, has also been a reporter and film critic for The Wall Street Journal. Her journalism has appeared in The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Vogue, Bazaar, and The New Republic. Salamon is the author of six books, White Lies, a novel; The Devil&#39;s Candy, a study of Hollywood film making gone awry; The Net of Dreams, a family memoir; The Christmas Tree, a novella that was a New York Times best-seller; and Facing the Wind.

When winter comes, Anna's blue fuzzy coat is worn-out and too small. Her mother thought, last winter, that shops would be open by now and that she would have money to buy nice things again. Instead, she and Anna pore over their last possessions of any value. Then they begin an elaborate plan of swapping to get Anna her new coat. First, they take Grandfather's gold watch to a nearby farm. The farmer agrees to give them wool from his sheep in return for the watch, but they must wait until spring, when he shears them. To an old woman with a spinning wheel Anna's mother offers a lamp. It will be summer before the wool will be finished. At the end of the summer, Anna and her mother pick lingonberries, make a pot of dye and "soon red yarn was hanging up to dry on a clothesline strung across the kitchen." A weaver receives a garnet necklace for turning the yarn into a bolt of cloth; the tailor accepts a porcelain teapot for his work. It's winter again, so Anna wears her new coat home. Because Christmas is coming, they decide to have a little celebration, for all the people who helped with a coat. "And I will make a Christmas cake just like I used to," Anna's mother says. Not only is this a highly instructive guide to clothes-making, but it's also a thoughtful chronicle of recovery, economic and personal, from the devastation of hard times. Lobel's resplendent pictures convey the passing of the seasons, cozily cluttered interiors and the compassion of the people working on Anna's coat. The story could be considered conventional, were it not for the inspiring atmosphere evoked in both words and illustrations. A New Coat is one of the brightest offerings of the year. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-Grade 2 In the tradition of Beskow's Pelle's New Suit (Harper, 1929), Ziefert tells the story of Anna's new coat. In contrast to the warmth of Pelle's Swedish mountain village is the war-torn town in post-World War II Eastern Europe in which Anna and her mother live. While Pelle trades chores for the making of his suit, Anna's mother trades treasured possessions from better daysa gold watch, a teapot, a lamp, and a necklace. Ziefert's writing is clear and succinct, but it is in Lobel's brightly colored paintings that the story truly unfolds. From crumbling rooms cluttered with mementos of a better life to the charm of the tiny sheep farm, the illustrations bring to life another time, another place, and a little girl whose delight in her new coat is just as great as that of many a young reader of this book. The expressiveness of the faces in Lobel's paintings brings life to the story. Ziefert's tale, based on a true story, carries a simple lesson that will be understood and cherished by all ages.

All the clues point to a violent mugging, but for Brunetti robbery seems altogether too convenient a motive. Then something very incriminating is discovered in the dead man&#39;s flat, something which points to the existence of a high level cabal - and Brunetti becomes convinced that somebody, somewhere, is taking great pains to provide a ready-made solution to the crime...In the second of Donna Leon&#39;s award-winning Commissario Brunetti novels, Brunetti is as fallibly human - and Venice as mysteriously beautiful - as Donna Leon&#39;s many loyal readers have become to expect.</p><p>Donna Leon was named by The Times as one of the 50 Greatest Crime Writers. She is an award-winning crime novelist, celebrated for the bestselling Brunetti series. Donna has lived in Venice for thirty years and previously lived in Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Iran and China, where she worked as a teacher. Donna&#39;s books have been translated into 35 languages and have been published around the world. Her previous novels featuring Commissario Brunetti have all been highly acclaimed; including Friends in High Places, which won the CWA Macallan Silver Dagger for Fiction, Fatal Remedies, Doctored Evidence, A Sea of Troubles and Beastly Things.To solve the murder of a young American soldier, commissario of Venice police Guido Brunetti encounters investigational constraints that leave him awed and embittered. Anna Fields&#39;s narration resonates with the emotional upheavals Brunetti feels as he conforms to police procedures that leave him stonewalled. Fields cautiously portrays the cast of characters, differentiating each one uniquely. We sense the sinister and innocent via her mediated expression, and appreciate the difficult case Guido Brunetti has undertaken. B.J.L.

Reprint.</p><p>Tamar Myers, who is of Amish background, is the author of several Pennsylvania Dutch mysteries, including <b>Custard's Last Stand, The Hand that Rocks the Ladle, Between a Wok and a Hard Place, Too Many Crooks Spoil the Broth</b>, and <b>The Crepes of Wrath</b>. Also the author of the <b>Den of Antiquity</b> series, she lives in South Carolina with her husband.Feisty Mennonite innkeeper and talented sleuth Magdalena Yoder offers a mix of murder and mouthwatering recipes in this, her ninth Pennsylvania Dutch mystery. When Lizzie Mast, a kindly Amish woman, dies of a drug overdose, Melvin Stoltzfus, the inept police chief of Hernia, Pa., asks Magdalena to investigate. Leaving her seven zany guests to fend for themselves on the A.L.P.O. (Amish Lifestyle Plan Option) at the PennDutch Inn and trying not to neglect her new love interest, handsome Jewish doctor Gabriel Rosen, Magdalena calls on Joseph Mast, Lizzie's widowed husband. Joseph attributes his wife's death to his neighbors the Keims and "rumschpringe" (the Amish equivalent of teenage rebellion). The two eldest Keim boys secretly purchased a car and ran over the Masts' Vietnamese pot-bellied pig and pet ferret. In retaliation, Joseph shot out the car's tires. Is it a simple case of retribution or something more sinister that led to Lizzie's murder? The Pennsylvania Dutch countryside provides a bucolic setting for Magdalena as she weaves in and out of the English (non-Amish) and Amish societies in her search for the killer. Magdalena's irrepressible personality, amusing colloquial speech and quirky habits (she keeps her pet kitten in her bra) will delight the reader, while the asides on Amish society offer insights into a traditional culture trying to retain its integrity in the 21st century.

Clay Wilson and, heck, R. Crumb himself. Ryan may be the most upsetting of them all, certainly in his <i>Angry Youth Comix</i>, which brings its mixture of scatology, sex, and billingsgate to an acme of noxious hilarity or, for some, nausea. The four-panel <i>Blecky Yuckerella</i> strips are as gross but, with kid protagonists, not as sexual or foul-mouthed. The body and its, uh, products constitute the primary font of all humor here, even in the relatively tranquil, subtle, downtime strip, "The Graveyard of Hilarious Cliches," for the last of those moribund apothegms is "Clean-up on aisle three!" Occasionally, garden-variety perverseness generates a punch line, as when Blecky, a Shirley Temple-like little girl--with whiskers and trailing flies!--explains that the sight of "a pathetic loser having a really crappy life" compels her to "make his life even crappier!" The strip's humor usually has to do more with crap than with perverseness. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It struck a mountain ridge on a still and moonless night and nestled like a pupa of death in the desiccated heart of an ancient pine.

The woman, camped nearby with her group of troubled teenagers, slept on and heard nothing.<br><br>She has brought them here by court order on a youth program to help them find themselves.

Moving from the towering wilds of the American West to the killing fields of Africa, <b>The Smoke Jumper</b> is the story of three people&#x2019;s quest for happiness and self-fulfillment, played out against the heroism of fire fighting in the wilderness and photojournalism at the edge of human experience &#x2014; a mesmerizing adventure for the spirit, told in the grandest tradition.</p><p>New York born and bred, Julia Bishop has no warning that spending the summer counseling troubled teens in Montana will change her life forever. Happily in love with smoke jumper and musician Ed Tully, she looks forward to spending the summer weekends with him in Missoula and is stunned and disturbed by the instant connection she feels to his best friend, Connor Ford. Connor, a Montana rancher and smoke jumper, loves fighting fires almost as much as he loves photography, and before the summer is barely started, he loves Julia Bishop just as deeply. The bond between the three is strong but the work of a smoke jumper is fraught with danger and the trio soon face death by fire. Survival changes their lives forever and places them on paths that divide Julia, Ed, and Connor just as surely as their individual journeys bind them irrevocably together. <i>The Smoke Jumper</i> is a tale of loyalty and guilt, honor and selfless love, and the human cost of choices made. <i>--Lois Faye Dyer</i><i>The elk emerged from the burning trees and stopped on the ridge above him.

Scott was an award-winning, bestselling novelist and a very complicated man. Early in their relationship, before they married, Lisey knew there was a place Scott went&#x2014;a place that both terrified and healed him, could eat him alive or give him the ideas he needed in order to live. Now it&#x2019;s Lisey&#x2019;s turn to face Scott&#x2019;s demons, to go to that terrifying place known as Boo&#x2019;ya Moon.

It is a beautiful, &#x201c;rich portrait of a marriage, and the complicated affection that outlives death&#x201d; (<i>The Washington Post</i>).</p><p>Since his first novel was published in 1974, Stephen King has stretched the boundaries of the written word, not only bringing horror to new heights, but trying his hand at nearly every possible genre, including children's books, graphic novels, serial novels, literary fiction, nonfiction, westerns, fantasy, and even e-books (remember The Plant?). With <i>Lisey's Story</i>, once again King is trying something different. <i>Lisey's Story</i> is as much a romance as it is a supernatural thriller--but don't let us convince you. Who better to tell readers if King has written a romantic thriller than Nora Roberts? We asked Nora to read <i>Lisey's Story</i> and give us her take. Check out her review below. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br><p> </p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Nora Roberts</strong><br><br><b>Nora Roberts, who also writes under the pseudonym J.D. Robb, is the author of way too many bestselling books to name here (over 150!), but some of our favorites include: <i>Angels Fall</i>, <i>Born in Death</i>, <i>Blue Smoke</i>, and <i>The Reef</i>.</b> <br><br> Stephen King hooked me about three decades ago with that sharply faceted, blood-stained jewel, <i>The Shining</i>. Through the years he's bumped my gooses with kiddie vampires, tingled my spine with beloved pets gone rabid, justified my personal fear of clowns and made me think twice about my cell phone. I've always considered <i>The Stand</i>--a long-time favorite--a towering tour de force, and have owed its author a debt as this was the first novel I could convince my older son to read from cover to cover.<p> But with <i>Lisey's Story</i>, King has accomplished one more feat. He broke my heart.</p><p> <i>Lisey's Story</i> is, at its core, a love story--heart-wrenching, passionate, terrifying and tender. It is the multi-layered and expertly crafted tale of a twenty-five year marriage, and a widow's journey through grief, through discovery and--this is King, after all--through a nightmare scape of the ordinary and extraordinary. Through Lisey's mind and heart, the reader is pulled into the intimacies of her marriage to bestselling novelist Scott Landon, and through her we come to know this complicated, troubled and heroic man.</p><p> Two years after his death, Lisey sorts through her husband's papers and her own shrouded memories. Following the clues Scott left her and her own instincts, she embarks on a journey that risks both her life and her sanity. She will face Scott's demons as well as her own, traveling into the past and into Boo'ya Moon, the seductive and terrifying world he'd shown her. There lives the power to heal, and the power to destroy.</p><p> Lisey Landon is a richly wrought character of charm and complexity, of realized inner strength and redoubtable humor. As the central figure she drives the story, and the story is so vividly textured, the reader will draw in the perfumed air of Boo'ya Moon, will see the sunlight flood through the windows of the Scott's studio--or the night press against them. Her voice will be clear in your ear as you experience the fear and the wonder. If your heart doesn't hitch at the demons she faces in this world and the other, if it doesn't thrill at her courage and endurance, you're going to need to check with a cardiologist, first chance.</p><p> <i>Lisey's Story</i> is bright and brilliant. It's dark and desperate. While I'll always consider <i>The Shining</i>, my first ride on King's wild Tilt-A-Whirl, a gorgeous, bloody jewel, I found, on this latest ride, a treasure box heaped with dazzling gems.</p><p> A few of them have sharp, hungry teeth. <i>--Nora Roberts</i> </p><br>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

On the one hand, they aspired to an ever-closer connection to Europe and North America, where, during much of this period, "scientific" thought condemned nonwhite races to an inferior category. Yet, with the heterogeneous racial makeup of their societies clearly before them and a growing sense of national identity impelling consideration of national futures, Latin American leaders hesitated. What to do? Whom to believe?</p><p>Latin American political and intellectual leaders' sometimes anguished responses to these dilemmas form the subject of The Idea of Race in Latin America. Thomas Skidmore, Aline Helg, and Alan Knight have each contributed chapters that succinctly explore various aspects of the story in Brazil, Argentina, Cuba, and Mexico. While keenly alert to the social and economic differences that distinguish one Latin American society from another, each author has also addressed common issues that Richard Graham ably draws together in a brief introduction.

Really <em>your</em> thoughts and desires? Perhaps not, says Australian psychic researcher Robert Bruce, author of the highly popular and groundbreaking <em>Astral Dynamics</em>.</p><p>It's not all angels and light beings out there aiding our enlightenment. Unseen psychic forces called Negatives&#x2014;Negs, for short&#x2014;are affecting us in many ways, and the more aware we are of this, the better we can choose whether to let this continue to happen.</p><p>Based on more than two decades of firsthand research and experience, Bruce reports that our minds are subject to influences from many unseen spiritual sources. Some of these influences and energies are not wholesome and try to affect our thoughts and behavior in unusual, even inappropriate, ways. They can influence how we think, feel, act, even how our bodies function. They can make us unhappy, irritable, confused, sick, unstable, even crazy. They can interfere with us, disturb our lives, even attack us psychically.</p><p>This is why we need practical tools and countermeasures for psychic self-defense, all of which Bruce provides. He explains everything you need to know&#x2014;who the Negs are, how they work, how they affect adults and children, and how to resist their interference. Think of this book as a supernatural expose for the beginner, a survival guide for those living the nightmare of being influenced by unfriendly spirit beings and forces of darkness, says Bruce. "I have lived through everything I describe and have spent decades searching for ways to survive and create spiritual peace and quiet for myself."</p></p><p>Robert Bruce is a psychic researcher.

His material is both spiritual and practical. I don't know another book that deals with callings in quite the same way."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>--Larry Dossey, M.D., author of Healing Words and Prayer Is Good Medicine<br><br>How do we know if we're following our true callings? How do we sharpen our senses to cut through the distractions of everyday reality and hear the calls that are beckoning us? <br><br>Callings is a passionate look at the search for authenticity. In a style that is poetic, exuberant, and keenly insightful, Gregg Levoy breathes contemporary life into the ancient topic of callings. He presents an illuminating and ultimately practical inquiry into how we listen and respond to our calls, whether at work or at home, in our relationships or in service.<br><br>Callings is the first book to examine the many kinds of calls we receive, and the great variety of channels through which they come to us. A calling may be to do something (change careers, go back to school, leave or start a relationship, move to the country, have a child) or to be something (more creative, less judgmental, more loving). You may be called toward or away from something, called to change or renew your commitment to something, or called to return to a place or pursuit in an entirely new way. You may be called toward whatever you have dared and double-dared yourself to do for as long as you can remember.<br><br>Gregg Levoy draws on the hard-won wisdom and powerful stories of people who have followed their own calls, to show us the many ways to translate a calling into action. While honoring a calling's essential mystery, the book also guides readers to ask and answer the fundamental questions that arise from any calling: How do we recognize it? How do we distinguish the true calls from the siren song? How do we handle our resistance to a call? What happens when we say no? What happens when we say yes?<br><br>Whether your interest in callings is personal or professional, and whether the calls you hear are great trumpetings or the more common daily summonses to pay attention to your intuition, you will find this beautiful book an inspiration. It is a compassionate guide to discovering your own callings and negotiating the tight passages to personal power and authenticity.</p><p>The lure of true calling is as powerful as it is exacting and Gregg Levoy's <i>Callings: Finding and Following an Authentic Life</i> plays upon this common yearning. Indeed, many recognize that there floats somewhere out there "... a call to each of us to materialize ourselves." And everyone can make his or her life "come true," attests Levoy, whose work has appeared in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, and <i>Psychology Today</i>, if one can learn to read the signs that point one toward one's calling.<p> But how do we attune--clear a path through ingrained skepticism, negative conditioning, and fear so that we can hear the call? This is the question fundamental to spiritual questing. Receptivity is the first step in the art of sign reading, discerning the calls that point life choices toward meaningful action. Levoy's tools include dream interpretation, relating physical symptoms to their metaphysical correspondences (i.e. the recurring pain in the neck), and recognizing serendipitous events. Learn to discern, Levoy instructs, distinguishing, for example, between true inner guidance and the babble in our heads. And don't expect a big "call," flashing chariots and burning bushes. Rather, Levoy will help the reader cultivate a sensitivity to the still, small voice within.</p><p> Since it's inspiration through old truths and classic adages, the success of the message depends, naturally, on a kind of practical clarity. At times frustrating, <i>Callings</i> entices the reader toward self-transformation with New Age rhetoric and examples not always applicable to our more ordinary plights. Quoting the impassioned Annie Dillard may be swell ("The thing is to stalk your calling in a certain skilled and supple way, to locate the most tender and live spot and plug into the pulse"), but--in the long run--metaphor is metaphor and how-to, though less stately and exalted, is the practical precursor to action. Readers familiar with the literature of self-actualization will want to skim the lengthy introduction with its fervent and redundant references to our spiritual spin doctors--Sufi poets Kabir and Rumi; Joseph Campbell; Kierkegaard. But like many deft cartographers of the subterranean terrain, Levoy's mixed bag of metaphor, anecdote, and myth ultimately inspires and encourages the hungry soul to define itself in relation to the divine. For those who can afford to ask these "quality-of- life" questions, <i>Callings</i> offers heartfelt crazy wisdom. Above all else, it's sound nutrient in our spiritually hollow time.</p>"Gregg Levoy offers a discerning eye for peering into one's life to translate the recurring symptoms of refusing the inner voices, to gather the courage to answer what calls. He does this with good writing, humor, and a strong clarion voice."<br>--Clarissa Pinkola Est�s, Ph.D., author of Women Who Run with the Wolves, The Gift of Story, and The Faithful Gardener<br><br>"Callings can help you discover your true vocation--and help you hear the still small voice that calls you by name."<br>--Sam Keen, Ph.D., author of Fire in the Belly and Hymns to an Unknown God<br><br>"Gregg Levoy has written about the nature of guidance with a ringing clarity. Callings is a spiritual seduction that gives form to a universal mystery. I'd recommend it to anyone who is seeking to hold the divine hand through a transition in their lives."<br>--Caroline Myss, Ph.D., author of Anatomy of the Spirit</p><h2>Mountain sheep;: A study in behavior and evolution (Wildlife behavior and ecology)</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Boxed Set trim. Volume I. 1691 illus. (50 color). Volume II. 1968 illus. (49 color). LC 85-18881&#x201c;Norman Rockwell: A Definitive Catalogue speaks eloquently, simply as an object, of its sponsors&#x2019; belief in its subject&#x2019;s art-historical importance. The scholarship is stupendous and thorough. Nearly 4,000 entries - all but a few illustrated and all identified as to medium, size, date of origin and whereabouts of original (surprisingly often &#x2018;&#x2019;unknown&#x2019;&#x2019;) -clearly express the intention that the book be used for reference; and its two volumes are bound and cased as if heavy archival use was anticipated.&#x201d;&#x2014;Arthur C.

His forays into commercial art included lively, Dickensian Christmas cards and a strong charcoal of Abe Lincoln as a young rail-splitter. His biting canvas, Negro in the Suburbs, reminiscent of Ben Shahn, rings with a cry for social justice. His series of sketches of women gossiping transcends all genres, and his pictures of astronauts landing on the moon are genuinely moving. Ranging from wacky doodles to richly illustrated story illustrations, this mammoth catalogue, the product of 10 years&#x2019; work, rescues Rockwell from his detractors and preserves those contributions worth saving.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i></p><h2>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Great Illustrated Classics)</h2><p>You are walking through the streets of London. It is getting dark and you want to get home quickly. You enter a narrow side-street. Everything is quiet, but as you pass the door of a large, windowless building, you hear a key turning in the lock. A man comes out and looks at you. You have never seen him before, but you realize immediately that he hates you. You are shocked to discover, also, that you hate him. Who is this man that everybody hates? And why is he coming out of the laboratory of the very respectable Dr Jekyll?</p><p>The young Robert Louis Stevenson suffered from repeated nightmares of living a double life, in which by day he worked as a respectable doctor and by night he roamed the back alleys of old-town Edinburgh. In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

Since 2010, their innovative baked goods have found their way into caf�s, restaurants and stores nationwide.<br><br>At Ovenly, our philosophy is to explore culinary traditions with an unexpected twist, while thoughtfully melding salty and sweet with a touch of spice. We are committed to crafting recipes that are complex, innovative and fun. Whether you are enjoying a cookie in our bakery or making one of our cake recipes at home, our goal is to provide you with joy through flavor.</p><p>*This chapter is a pared-down guide to our baking and snack nomenclature, and to the necessities you'll need to accomplish the recipes in this book. Included here are facts, tips, tricks, not-so-common ingredients and equipment that we think are most important. This guide is not a list of every single process or ingredient you will find in this book; it's just a summary of the less common or more essential ones .We have written this book with the assumption that the home baker has a general knowledge of tools and ingredients. <br> <br>ESSENTIAL TOOLS <br> <br> <i>Bench Scraper</i> <br> <br>A bench scraper is indispensable for scraping surfaces; for turning p�te bris�e and other butter doughs while rolling; for transferring ingredients, such as chopped chocolate, from a cutting board to a bowl (or other cooking apparatus); and for cutting brownies, bars and coffee cakes. <br> <br> <i>Cardboard Rounds</i> <br> <br>Precut corrugated cardboard rounds are precise in shape and totally necessary when decorating cakes. Hidden by the frosting, these rounds help to keep cakes sturdy and allow them to be transported more easily. Rounds can be purchased at kitchenware or craft stores or online. <br> <br> <i>Digital Scale</i> <br> <br>For dedicated home bakers, and for professional ones like us, a scale provides the most accurate measurements for consistency. <br> <br> <i>Dry and Liquid Measuring Cups</i> <br> <br>As their names imply, dry measuring cups are for measuring dry ingredients (flours, nuts, seeds, cocoa), while liquid measuring cups are for measuring wet ingredients (oils, waters, dairy products). Use a spoon to transfer ingredients to your dry measures, fill them completely and use a knife or bench scraper to level them off. Liquid measures feature gradations (usually in cups and milliliters) and include a pour spout for easy usage. <br> <br>Why not just use one or the other? you ask. Liquid measures are generally accurate within a fraction of an ounce, no matter the liquid. For example, 8 ounces (1 cup) of olive oil is going to be generally equal to a cup of buttermilk. <br> <br>This does not hold true for dry measures, since dry ingredients settle. For example, a cup of flour may weigh much more than a cup of oats or dried cherries. For our cookbook, we've chosen to measure in cups, taking into account the weight diferences of diferent types of ingredients, so using the right measuring tools is important when preparing an Ovenly recipe. <br> <br> <i>Offset Spatula</i> <br> <br>Offsets spatulas are integral in frosting cakes, great for cupcake frosting details, perfect for smoothing out batters in pans and much more. <br> <br> <i>Oven Thermometer</i> <br> <br>Don't let your oven temperature display or dial fool you�ovens vary in temperature, despite what your digital screen or dial may tell you. We always use an oven thermometer to ensure baking accuracy, and we suggest you do, too. <br> <br> <i>Paper or Silicone Baking Cups</i> <br> <br>These allow for the easy removal of muffins and cupcakes from the pan, prevent sticking and make cleaning up much easier. We prefer to use unbleached baking cups, such as those from Beyond Gourmet. <br> <br> <i>Pastry Bags and Tips</i> <br> <br>For executing cake details and frosting perfect cupcakes, we suggest investing a few dollars in a reusable pastry bag and a variety of tip sizes and shapes. If you are a novice cake decorator, we recommend purchasing either size 14, 18 and 22 open star tips and size 2, 4 and 6 plain/round tips to start or a basic cake-decorating kit, such as Wilton's 12-piece cupcake decorating set (widely available at craft stores or online). <br> <br> <i>Revolving Cake Stand</i> <br> <br>If you get into cake decorating, a revolving cake stand (like a lazy Susan) will make your life much easier. A revolving cake stand allows you to spin your cake while you frost, and it helps you to determine whether you have decorated a cake evenly and perfectly. We prefer models with a heavy cast-iron base (like those by Ateco), but plastic works, too. These are widely available in kitchenware stores and on the internet. <br> <br> <i>Rimmed Sheet Pans &amp; Baking Pans</i> <br> <br>We prefer uncoated, rimmed, steel or aluminum half-sheet (18 x 13-inch) and quarter-sheet (9 x 13-inch) pans (also known as rimmed cookie sheets) for home use. They are ideal for baking cookies, rolling shortbread and roasting nuts and seeds. Sheet pans of various sizes are widely available at kitchenware stores and on the internet. <br> <br>When we refer to a baking pan, we recommend using one that is at least 2-inches deep. Our standard baking pans are 9x9-inches or 9x13-inches. <br> <br> <i>Ruler</i> <br> <br>To create a lattice pie crust, evenly sized Hot Tarts or square bars, we recommend using a dedicated metal kitchen ruler. It will make cutting easier and will make your pastry look perfect. <br> <br> <i>Scoops</i> <br> <br>For us, scoops are essential in cookie making. Using a scoop ensures that each cookie is the same size and, therefore, that each bakes evenly. Scoops come in a variety of sizes, but we recommend purchasing one #20 scoop (1% ounces) for larger cookies and one #30 (1 ounce) for smaller cookies. <br> <br> <i>Stand Mixers &amp; Hand Mixers</i> <br> <br>While we acknowledge that stand mixers are an investment, they are worth it. Well built and powerful, stand mixers are long-lasting and great for aerating batters, whipping creams and more. They are also very useful in savory cooking and bread making. <br> <br>If you do not have a stand mixer, a hand mixer can be used to make recipes that call for a stand mixer. However, hand mixers generally are not as powerful; in recipes that call for aeration or whipping, or to fully incorporate some of our thicker cookie batters, you may have to add a minute or so to your mixing time. <br> <br>ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS <br> <br> <i>Baking Powder</i> <br> <br>Baking powder is a combination of baking soda and an acidic salt, such as cream of tartar, plus cornstarch. Like baking soda, baking powder is a chemical leavening agent that causes batters to rise when they are baked. Combined with baking soda, baking powder does most of the leavening, while the baking soda neutralizes the acids found in the powder. <br> <br>Too much baking powder can produce bitter batter. It also can make a batter rise too rapidly, creating large air bubbles, which may cause the batter to break and fall. If you use too little baking powder, your baked goods will be dense. For this reason, when you are creating your own recipes, be mindful of how you use baking powder and how much you use in a recipe. <br> <br> <i>Baking Soda</i> <br> <br>Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) is a leavening agent. When combined with an acid (like that found in baking powder, yogurt, lemons and more), it releases carbon dioxide, which makes batters expand and rise. <br> <br> <i>Butter</i> <br> <br>When we specify butter at room temperature (about 65 degrees Fahrenheit), we mean just that. For recipes that call for mixing and creaming butter, the butter should be cool to the touch and easily retain your fingerprint when you touch it. Butter that is too soft (over 68 degrees Fahrenheit), melted butter, or butter that has been melted and then cooled, should not be used in recipes that require creaming. <br> <br>We use unsalted Grade A butter (preferably local) in our recipes. The fresher the butter and the higher its quality, the better tasting your baked goods and pastries will be. If you don't plan on using butter right away, freeze it to preserve its flavor. <br> <br> <i>Cardamom</i> <br> <br>We prefer to buy whole green cardamom pods and to grind them ourselves. Grind whole pods in a coffee or spice grinder until a fine powder forms. Remove any fibrous strands before using. <br> <br> <i>Chocolate</i> <br> <br>The general rule of thumb is buy the best chocolate you can afford, and one that has the fewest ingredients. Brands we love include Callebaut, Guittard, Scharffen Berger, Taza and Valrhona. For most recipes, unless otherwise notes, we recommend using chocolate with a 60 percent cocoa content or higher. The higher the percentage of cocoa, the darker�and the less sweet and more bitter�the chocolate will be. <br> <br>For our vegan chocolate chip cookie recipe, be sure to use a chocolate that does not contain milk or milk solids (most high-quality dark and bittersweet chocolates do not contain dairy products). <br> <br> <i>American-Process (Natural) vs. Dutch-Process Cocoa Powder</i> <br> <br>American-process (natural) cocoa powder is acidic and, therefore, will react with and activate leavening agents (baking soda, baking powder and so on). Dutch-process cocoa powder has been alkalized to make it neutral, and it will not react with leavening agents. <br> <br>Generally, American-process cocoa powders are sharper, smokier and more acidic than Dutch-process cocoa powders, which are deeper and have a purer chocolate flavor. For the most part, our recipes do not rely on cocoa powders to enhance the rising power of leavening agents, you can use American-process and Dutch-process cocoa powders interchangeably. The key is to buy high-quality cocoa, like Guittard or Scharffen Berger. <br> <br> <i>Dark Dutch-Process Cocoa Powder</i> <br> <br>Dark Dutch-process cocoa powder (also called extra dark, black, black onyx and cocoa noir) has a high alkali content, a low fat content, an intense bittersweet chocolate flavor and a beautiful black hue. This cocoa powder is essential to our Brooklyn Blackout Cake and our Salted Dark Chocolate Pudding [PAGE TK]. Since dark Dutch-process cocoa powder can dry out cookies and other baked goods, be sure to use it in very wet doughs and in small amounts in other cookery. <br> <br>This cocoa powder is available by special order from Sahadi's (www.sahadis.com) and Surfas Culinary District (www.culinarydistrict.com). <br> <br> <i>Eggs</i> <br> <br>Eggs come in a few different sizes (large, extra-large and so on). We use large eggs in all our recipes. A general rule is to bake with eggs that are at room temperature. At room temperature, eggs and dairy products combine to form a bond that traps air. When batters and doughs are heated, the air expands, producing a lighter crumb. For this reason, we also like to let our milk and creams come to room temperature before baking, unless otherwise noted. <br> <br> <i>Testing Eggs for Freshness</i> <br> <br>We prefer local eggs from pasture-raised hens. Since these often don't have an expiration date on them, stick any questionable whole eggs in a bowl of water to determine their freshness. Fresh eggs will sink, and rotten eggs will float. So if any of your eggs float, throw them out. <br> <br> <i>Separating Eggs</i> <br> <br>Crack the egg on the side of a bowl, pry the shell open and let the whites run out until all that remains is the yolk. Or crack the egg on a flat surface, dump the egg into the palm of your hand and let the whites run through your fingers until all that's left is the yolk. <br> <br>We prefer to make our own [PAGE TK], but if you use store-bought, be sure to reduce the jam (or jelly or marmalade) before using it in a recipe, such as in our holiday cookies. To do so, bring the jam to a boil in a saucepan, and then simmer it for 5 minutes to thicken it. Let it cool before using. <br> <br> <i>Pomegranate Molasses</i> <br> <br>One of our favorite ingredients, pomegranate molasses lends a bright, tart and fruity flavor to cakes and frostings (and it's all natural!). When not using it in one of these recipes, try it in a cocktail. Pomegranate molasses is available from Sahadi's (www.sahadis.com) and most Middle Eastern specialty stores. <br> <br> <i>Milk, Creams &amp; Buttermilk</i> <i>Milks</i> <br> <br>In all our recipes that call for milk, use whole milk. Whole milk contains about 3.5 percent fat, and as you would guess, 2 percent milk has that exact fat content and skim contains none. Fat helps bind ingredients together and will help your baked goods and pastries come out tender and moist. <br> <br> <i>Buttermilk</i> <br> <br>Buttermilk adds a rich tang and moisture to many of our recipes. We believe in using the real stuff, full fat, if you can find it. If not, widely available low-fat buttermilk will do. <br> <br> <i>Heavy Cream vs. Whipping Cream</i> <br> <br>Heavy cream and whipping cream differ in that the former contains at least 36 percent milk fat and the latter contains at least 30 percent. For our recipes, you can use either type. For recipes that call for whipped cream or for whipping cream until it is stif, the more fat, the more stable it will be. We recommend using heavy cream (the cream with the higher fat content) for piping, frostings and toppings. <br> <br> <i>Natural Food Coloring</i> <br> <br>We use only natural food coloring for our red velvet cake and our pomegranate frosting. The artificial stuff is a derivative of coal tar and petroleum (no joke), so we avoid it. Natural food coloring from India Tree and Chef Master Naturals are largely available in health food stores and on the internet. <br> <br> <i>Nuts &amp; Seeds</i> <br> <br>As with spices, the fresher nuts and seeds are, the better. Since nuts and seeds are high in fat, they can go rancid. To prevent rancidity, we keep ours in an airtight container in the freezer (which also preserves their flavor better than the refrigerator) if we won't be using them right away. Experiment by substituting your favorite nuts and seeds in any of our recipes that call for them. <br> <br> <i>Oats</i> <br> <br>We use rolled oats (not quick-cooking oats) in our recipes. Rolled oats and gluten-free rolled oats differ only in the fact that the latter is milled in a gluten-free certified facility. If you don't have a gluten sensitivity, feel free to use regular oats. <br> <br> <i>Organic vs. Local</i> <br> <br>Local ingredients found at markets or in specialty grocery stores create a lower carbon footprint and�especially if purchased at a farmers' market or directly from a farmer�tend to be fresher. As we've said, in both baking and cooking, the fresher the ingredients, the better. When locally grown ingredients are not available, we try to use organic ones wherever we can.

Only hours earlier King the prophet for racial and economic justice in America ended his final speech with the words, I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight, that we as a people will get to the Promised Land.&#x201d;<br><br>Acclaimed public intellectual and best-selling author Michael Eric Dyson uses the fortieth anniversary of King's assassination as the occasion for a provocative and fresh examination of how King fought, and faced, his own death, and we should use his death and legacy. Dyson also uses this landmark anniversary as the starting point for a comprehensive reevaluation of the fate of Black America over the four decades that followed King's death. Dyson ambitiously investigates the ways in which African-Americans have in fact made it to the Promised Land of which King spoke, while shining a bright light on the ways in which the nation has faltered in the quest for racial justice. He also probes the virtues and flaws of charismatic black leadership that has followed in King's wake, from Jesse Jackson to Barack Obama.<br><br>Always engaging and inspiring, <i>April 4, 1968</i> celebrates the prophetic leadership of Dr. King, and challenges America to renew its commitment to his deeply moral vision.</p><p><b>Michael Eric Dyson</b>, named by <i>Ebony</i> as one of the hundred most influential black Americans, is the author of sixteen books, including <i>Holler if You Hear Me</i> , <i>Is Bill Cosby Right?</i> and <i>I May Not Get There With You: The True Martin Luther King Jr.</i> He is currently University Professor of Sociology at Georgetown University. He lives in Washington, D.C.With deep, resonant projection that at times sounds eerily like Martin Luther King, Jr.&#39;s, own voice, Dyson narrates his deep exploration into the most significant aspects of King&#39;s legacy since his assassination on April 4, 1968. Paying particular attention to how politicians and cultural leaders have utilized King and his message, Dyson contrasts the real King with the misappropriated icon. This approach allows listeners to see the height of King&#39;s impact at the time of his death and the symbol of racial equality he has embodied since. Even when not echoing King&#39;s cadence and intonation, Dyson delivers a strong narrative performance that illuminates his belief in King&#39;s dream.

By the illustrator of Raising Sweetness.</p><p><p>PreS-Gr 2-This delightful picture book begins before the title page, as a father and two children get into their car to head out to lunch. However, a run-in with a huge mud puddle necessitates a stop at the car wash. As they enter, the children imagine that they are descending into the ocean in a submarine and immediately "Close hatch" (the car's sunroof). Inside, the different cleaning mechanisms become sea creatures, from "Coral reef" sponges to the "Giant arms" of the cloth "Octopus" to "Seaweed" brushes. After escaping the "Hurricane" of the rinse cycle, the vehicle passes through the "Red-hot breath" and finally ascends into the outside world. Then it's on to the fast-food restaurant and lunch-only to spill food all over the clean car. The rhythmic text emulates the relentless beat of a car wash: "Windows up. Engine off. On track." Fashioned from gouache, acrylics, pencil, and "some odds and ends," Karas's illustrations contrast sepia-toned scenes of the real world with vivid pinks, blues, and greens inside the car wash. Filled with clever touches, such as hot-pink fabric strips for the octopus legs and glass beads for water running down the windshield, these offbeat pictures provide a perfect counterpart to a story that is firmly rooted in a familiar experience. Creative, clever, and original, this offering is destined to be a hit in storytime or when shared one-on-one.-Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Carroll County Public Library, Eldersburg, MDSUEN, Anastasia. </p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Ages 2-6. The glorious slop of a car wash is captured in eye-popping collages and jolly play-by-play. The co-authors, twin sisters, place another set of twins, a brother and sister, in the family car with Dad, on the way to lunch. When mud spatters all over the car, Dad takes a detour to the car wash. Karas' imaginative, crazy re-creations of a car wash from a kid's perspective are great: the car becomes a submarine, and a bubbly sea, a coral reef of sponges, and a hurricane of blowing air appear outside the porthole. It's highly inventive fun that transforms a potentially frightening experience into an entertaining underwater adventure. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Prepared with Pierre Franey's characteristic flair and ebullience, this new collection offers three hundred recipes that appeared in The New York Times but were never before published in a cookbook. These recipes are as delicious as those in his two earlier 60-Minute Gourmet collections and combine everything that was great about Pierre Franey's cooking: fresh, flavorful, low-fat ingredients, ease of preparation, and the commandment "Don't spend all evening in the kitchen!" <br><br>Following a successful career as a restaurant chef, Pierre Franey became a food writer for The New York Times in 1975, when he accepted the challenge to write a regular column featuring recipes that would take less than one hour to prepare. Though he was initially concerned that the time limit might detract from the quality of the dishes, he quickly recalled the delicious foods prepared in his childhood home in France, which often took very little time to cook. Over the two decades that his column appeared, he developed thousands of dishes that can--indeed, must--be made in only minutes to bring them to a state of absolute perfection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Cooking with the 60-Minute Gourmet is a dazzling collection of great recipes. The book opens with appetizers, salads, and soups, then moves into meats, poultry, seafood, pasta, and, finally, desserts. Among the many delectable recipes are Green Bean and Red Pepper Salad, Lobster and Wild Rice Salad, Double Veal Chops with Braised Spring Vegetables, Sirloin Steak with Crushed Peppercorns, Roasted Baby Chickens with Spicy Mango Barbecue Sauce, Shrimp with Snow Peas and Tomatoes, Fettuccine with Goat Cheese and Asparagus, Broiled Fennel and Zucchini with Parmesan Cheese, Summer Fruit Salad, and Poached Pears in Red Wine and Cassis. <br><br>A special tribute to Pierre Franey is offered in a fond Foreword by his lifelong friend the master chef Jacques P�pin. The recipes have been collected and updated by Bryan Miller, a longtime collaborator of Franey's, with help from Claudia Franey Jensen, one of p�re Franey's daughters, who has also contributed an Introduction. As a step-by-step guide and an inspiration for better eating, this great cookbook will soon be considered a must in every home cook's library.</p><p>Julia Child may have been responsible for helping American cooks ease into French cooking techniques, but it was Pierre Franey who brought it all home with his <i>New York Times</i> recipe column, "The 60-Minute Gourmet." Franey took the fear and drudgery out of stylish, flavorful cooking and injected healthy doses of fun. Many were his fans, and many a weekly dinner menu was planned with a hole in the middle to allow for Franey's latest culinary exploration. The best part was the timing. With the basic ingredients on hand and with a little skill under the belt, any home cook could, in fact, get out of the kitchen in 60 minutes and put on the table what many would consider a gourmet dish.<p> Thanks be to Bryan Miller and to Pierre Franey's family for gathering up 300 of the great teacher's recipes from his column and assembling them for <i>Cooking with the 60-Minute Gourmet</i>. So true to context are these recipes that you can hear Franey tell you what the ingredients are as you read the list, and hear him explain how a dish goes together as you read through the directions--which is to say, there's magic in these pages.</p><p> In chapters that include appetizers, salads, soups, poultry, beef, pork, veal, lamb, seafood, pasta, vegetables, and desserts, you will find the likes of Garlic Potatoes, Ziti with Mussels and Broccoli, Salmon with Sorrel Sauce, Broiled Skirt Steak Cajun Style, Indonesian-Style Chicken Breasts, Pumpkin Sage Soup, Tomato and Lentil Salad, and a Cold Lobster Appetizer with Spicy Mustard Sauce. Check out Franey's spicy mango barbecue sauce (he serves it with roasted baby chickens). There are celebrity chefs today who call such a sauce new and bold, which only shows how far out ahead Pierre Franey always was. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p><b>Pierre Franey</b> was born in 1921 in Saint Vinnemer, a small village in Burgundy, France. He learned the basics of cooking from his mother and grandmother, and when he was fourteen, he was sent to Paris to become a cook. After a stellar career as executive chef at New York's superb French restaurant Le Pavillon, Franey began his hugely popular "60-Minute Gourmet" column for The New York Times in 1975. It was syndicated in several hundred newspapers and soon led to the two bestselling cookbooks The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet and The New York Times More 60-Minute Gourmet. He published more than a dozen cookbooks in his career, including several collaborations with Craig Claiborne. Pierre Franey died in 1996, leaving us an enduring legacy of fine food and good taste.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>The End of the Story (High Risk Books)</h2><p>This engagingly human and candid novel takes us deep into a world of obsession in which a happily settled woman attempts to piece together the fragments of an unresolved episode from her past. She recalls a period when, as a writer in her thirties, she was living and working on the other coast and found herself involved in a powerful yet uncertain relationship with a much younger man. As she examines and reinterprets events from the distance of time, she recounts in absorbing detail the increasing complexity of her experience, its gradual dissolution, and the disorienting spaces it left behind. With ruthless honesty, artful analysis, and crystalline depictions of human and natural landscapes, The End of the Story combines a deeply serious intention with an abiding sense of the absurd as it illuminates the dilemmas of loss and the fallibility of memory.</p><p>Lydia Davis is an award-winning author and translator. She teaches creative writing at Bard College in upstate New York.The narrator of this novel, who never reveals her name, is writing a novel about an obsessive relationship she had with a younger man. Although the woman did not seem totally committed while the couple was together, she became completely obsessed with her former partner after they separated. This first-person remembrance, with events imprecisely defined and sometimes out of sequence, is self-conscious and introspective. The narration is highly descriptive, and there is no dialog. The narrator comments that "my thoughts are not orderly-one is interrupted by another, or one contradicts another, and in addition to that, my memories are quite often false, confused, abbreviated, or collapsed into one another." A more apt description of the style would be hard to imagine. For anyone who has had a failed intimate relationship, this book could be uncomfortable reading.

The author of many literary novels and stories in practically every genre, his novels have won and been shortlisted for numerous awards including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Whitbread and Guardian Fiction Prize. In 1999, he was given the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award; in 2001, he was inducted into the SF Hall of Fame; and in 2007, he was named a SFWA Grandmaster. Michael Moorcock is also a musician who has performed since the seventies with his own band, the Deep Fix; and, as a member of the prog rock band, Hawkwind, won a gold disc. His tenure as editor of New Worlds magazine in the sixties and seventies is seen as the high watermark of SF editorship in the UK, and was crucial in the development of the SF New Wave. Michael Moorcock&#39;s literary creations include Hawkmoon, Corum, Von Bek, Jerry Cornelius and, of course, his most famous character, Elric. He has been compared to, among others, Balzac, Dumas, Dickens, James Joyce, Ian Fleming, J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard.

He revels in unexpected turns of fate and relishes the picturesque, strangely compelling details that historians often miss. Interweaving exhaustive scholarship with winning humor in an essay on astronomy, he recounts how the arrogant Tycho Brahe lost the bridge of his nose during a duel with a rival scientist over "which of them was the better mathematician." A few pieces consider historic clashes between "those traditional opponents Science and Religion." Fascinated by people who probe the outer limits of knowledge and geography, Connell provides a blow-by-blow account of the famous debate between Thomas Huxley and Bishop Wilberforce over evolution and describes the searing conflict between Galileo and the Catholic Church over heliocentrism. "White Lantern" the best essay of the bunch passionately (even enviously) details the amazing race to the South Pole between pragmatic Norwegian Roald Amundsen and romantic Englishman Captain Robert Scott, in a narrative even Jon Krakauer would admire. Connell sagely points out that "Amundsen, the victor, is not as renowned as the loser," because a dead hero (Scott died on the return trip) is more likely to captivate the public's imagination. Confessing a hopeless attraction to "buried treasure, monsters, ghosts, derelict ships, inexplicable footprints, and luminous objects streaking through the sky," Connell chronicles journeys of absolute, disastrous futility the searches for Atlantis, the Seven Cities of Gold and the Northwest Passage. These skillfully crafted essays will please any history, science or adventure buff. (Sept. 30)Forecast: Connell's Sun of the Morning Star: Custer and the Little Bighorn was a much-praised bestseller.

Blogs, tweets and newspaper articles appear daily on the subject, many of them repetitive, most of them admitting they don't know what will happen. Amidst the twittering, the thoughts of Jean-Claude Carri�re and Umberto Eco come as a breath of fresh air. There are few people better placed to discuss the past, present and future of the book. Both of them avid book collectors with a deep understanding of history, they have explored through their work, both written and visual, the many and varied ways in which ideas have been represented through the ages.<br><br>This beautifully produced book, an object of desire in itself, is the transcription of a long conversation between the two men in which they discuss a vast range of subjects, from what can be defined as the first book, to the idea of the library, the burning of books both accidental and deliberate, and what will happen to knowledge and memory when infinite amounts of information are available at the click of a mouse. En route there are delightful digressions into personal anecdote about everything from Eco's first computer to the book Carri�re is most sad to have sold.<br><br>Readers will close this book feeling that they have had the privilege of eavesdropping on an intimate discussion between two great minds. And while, as Carri�re says, the one certain thing about the future is that it is unpredictable, it is clear from this conversation that, in some form or other, the book will survive.

S. Lewis and Maurice Sendak. This extensive collection of MacDonald's personal correspondence offers privileged insights into the inner thoughts and visionary ideas of one of Scotland's greatest storytellers.<br>An Expression of Character draws from more than 3,000 of MacDonald's letters to friends and family members, many not previously published. Highly regarded as a MacDonald scholar, Glenn Edward Sadler has arranged the most significant of MacDonald's letters chronologically, dividing his life into significant stages: his boyhood in Huntly and student days at Aberdeen University; his marriage and fatherhood; his career as a novelist; his lecture tour in America in 1872; and his later days in Bordighera, Italy. Sadler skillfully introduces each section, summarizing the significant milestones in MacDonald's life. Sixteen pages of photographs, including many of the MacDonald family, also help capture this intriguing literary figure.<br>Fascinating, at times lyrical, and often moving, these letters provide a window into MacDonald's personal and spiritual life. Most of his letters are earthy and practical, showing his concern for the events of everyday life, his warm attachment to friends, and the importance of his role as husband and father. Other letters reveal MacDonald's spiritual approach to life and the develop ment of his religious views. Especially significant was his firm belief in what C. S. Lewis defined as "good Death" and in the glorious life hereafter.<br>Readers of MacDonald will find in these letters penetrating glimpses of a deeply religious and sensitive man. To the specialist and general reader alike the letters speak with heartfelt sincerity and warmth. Those familiar with MacDonald's fiction and poetry will find the best portrait yet of the man himself.</p><p>Glenn Edward Sadler is professor of English at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania.A thorough compilation of letters that sheds new light on the Scottish writer and minister (1824-1905), a seminal figure in modern fantastic literature. <p>Since his rediscovery in 1947 by C.S. Lewis, MacDonald's romances (especially Lilith and Phantastes) and fairy tales have been ranked as classics of world literature. But despite a slew of biographies, the Scot's inner life has remained somewhat veiled, a problem that this outstanding collection helps to redress. The letters--directed for the most part to MacDonald's wife and children--disclose little about his literary tastes (although he does confess an aversion for Thackeray) and nothing about his writing methods. But they are aglow with what editor Sadler (English/Bloomsburg University) calls MacDonald's'`incurable optimism,'' a product of his deeply held Christian faith (the same theological outlook that made his books the prototypes for C.S. Lewis's Narnia septet). At age 21, MacDonald writes that ``God is now with me....I try to trace him in little things.'' Later, he tells his mother that ``I wish to be delivered from myself. I wish to be made holy.'' Letters to Lewis Carroll, John Ruskin, Thomas Carlyle, and other notables underscore this spiritual drive, which is evident especially in the face of tragedy: Of his brother's death, MacDonald writes that ``what he was he is now--only expanded, enlarged, and glorified.'' He chats about travels to Boston and Algiers; lectures, homilies, poetry, and novels; the griefs of old age (``I have never known such a time. Friend after friend going'')--each letter adding to the overall impression that, in MacDonald, English literature came as close as it ever has to producing a genuine saint. Yet another treasure, noble and uplifting, from Britain's Victorian trove. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But you will recognize them... It&#39;s about being gay, being straight, falling in love, sorrowful partings, death, and fantastic circumstances. Bending the Landscape stretches the standard fantasy genre. In the groundbreaking anthology, queer writers write fantasy for the first time, and genre writers explore queer characters. But don&#39;t expect the usual fantasy backdrops-these stories will give you a frisson, a thrill, as they fizz off the page.</p><p><i>Bending the Landscape</i> will be a series of anthologies focused on homosexual issues in genre fiction, but this one isn't so neatly pigeonholed as all that. Gayness, or someone's discovery of his or her gayness, is indeed a common motif to all the stories, but in some it is central; in others, it's just a quality a character has--they happen to be having or have had a relationship with someone of the same sex. It's generous in size, 22 stories, and generous in its embrace, ranging in tone from sitcom-like light entertainment ("In Mysterious Ways," by Tanya Huff, and "Magicked Tricks" by K. L Berac), to realism ("Gestures Too Late on a Gravel Road" by Mark W. Tiedemann, and "Full Moon and Empty Arms" by M. W. Keiper), to realistic horror ("The House of the Man in the Moon" by Richard Bowes). Mythic fantasy, fairy tales, and ghost stories are all here too, so this is more like reading a survey than a tightly thematic anthology. The variety is appropriate. Neither fantasy nor sex comes in just one flavor. If you're at all interested in anything besides vanilla, sample this.Nicola Griffith's novels include Ammonite, Slow River, Stay and The Blue Palace.

Accompanied by more than 250 rare color and black-and-white stills--including many from recent films--the new edition is unmatched in its panoramic view, conveying a sense of cinema's sweep in the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries as it is practiced in the United States and around the world.<br><br>Wheeler Winston Dixon and Gwendolyn Audrey Foster present new and amended coverage of the industry in addition to updating the birth and death dates and final works of notable directors.

It details significant periods in world cinema, including the early major industries in Europe, the dominance of the Hollywood studio system in the 1930s and 1940s, and the French New Wave of the 1960s. Attention is given to small independent efforts in developing nations and the more personal independent film movement that briefly flourished in the United States, the significant filmmakers of all nations, and the effects of censorship and regulation on production everywhere. In addition, the authors incorporate the stories of women and other minority filmmakers who have often been overlooked in other texts.<br><br>"This book provides an overview of the last hundred plus years of international film history.

Garth Ennis, who is also known for his popular Vertigo series Preacher, always manages to weave together the dark and horrific with the commonplace to epitomize the graphic-novel medium. John Constantine, Hellblazer: Damnation&#39;s Flame collects issues 72 to 77 of the DC Comics series in a volume that is really composed of four short stories. In the primary tale of the collection, Constantine, a trench-coated magus, wanders the streets of New York City. Reeling from the loss of his lover, Kit, he literally falls under the spell of a minor magician. Constantine&#39;s physical body is abused in a homeless shelter while his soul travels the barren roads of a tiny slice of hell. His companion on the journey is President John F. Kennedy, who has been trapped in this limbo world since moments after his assassination. The site of the ever-suffering Kennedy will be difficult for many readers, but through Constantine&#39;s interactions with the President on their journey to hell&#39;s White House, Ennis punctures many of the myths that have shaped late-20th-century America. Kennedy is shown to be all too human, and the ruler of this hell, a ghostly Abraham Lincoln, reveals himself as the only bigger myth-figure able to free Kennedy with a heavy dose of reality. &#34;Act of Union,&#34; the second story, flashes back to 1980 with a quotidian narrative about Kit and Constantine&#39;s first meeting. This is a small, beautiful story that demonstrates Ennis&#39;s impressive range as a writer (especially when compared to the bloody opening selection). William Simpson&#39;s sketchy artwork perfectly captures the mood of Ennis&#39;s word balloons. &#34;Confessions of an Irish Rebel&#34; is another tale with a smaller and less mystical scope than the opening, but, as Constantine becomes mixed up with his old friend Dublin, things take a turn toward gore and violence. Finally, &#34;And the Crowd Goes Wild&#34; is actually a frame narrative, a story told in a bar that again moves back over a decade, to the night Chas Chandler gave John a ride in his cab and ended up being involved in a terrifying case that touched hell itself. --Patrick O&#39;Kelley</p><p></p><h2>New Haven Railroad (Railroad Color History)</h2><p>Captured in rare archival imagery, readers can explore the &#34;New Haven&#34;, the legendary railroad of New York, New Haven, and Hartford. From 1872 to 1969 this railroad connected Boston and Providence with New York City. New Haven&#39;s four-track electric mainline across the Hell Gate Bridge into New York City carried millions of commuters and travelers and is one of the most recognized railroad images in the world. The book includes a large selection of New Haven print advertising featuring the famous Shore Line Route as well as the memorable orange, black, and white color scheme.

A suspended sailor happens on a maritime auction in Barcelona, where he meets the beautiful Tanger Soto, a museum curator whose winning bid buys her a 17th-century atlas that may reveal the final resting place of the <i>Dei Gloria</i>. Coy, the sailor, is totally smitten, so it's no surprise that he signs on to help Tanger track the sunken ship to its grave in waters he's sailed since childhood. Enlisting the aid of a diver friend, Coy and Tanger stay a few steps ahead of the crooked salvagers who've been trying to get the atlas, outmaneuvering the attempts on their lives and the efforts to keep them from the treasure. Perez-Reverte (<i>The Fencing Master</i>, <i>The Club Dumas</i>) is better at plumbing the mysteries of the human heart than those of the sea, but <i>The Nautical Chart</i> manages to combine history, suspense, and obsessive love in a slow-paced but ultimately engrossing read. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2001, 0-15-100534-6<br>Published in paperback by Harcourt, 2002, 0-15-601305-3 <br></p><h2>The Joy of Beading: More than 50 Easy Projects for Jewelry, Flowers, Decor, Accessories</h2><p>Beaded earrings are nice.

Rice: California Block Prints</h2><p>William Seltzer Rice (1873-1963) was a young artist of twenty-seven when he stepped off a train in Stockton, California, in 1900; he had left his home in Pennsylvania to take the job of assistant art supervisor for the Stockton public schools. California became not only his lifelong home but also his muse, inspiring a prolific career in art.<p>Rice soon moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where the region's Arts and Crafts movement was flowering. He was talented in several mediums, but block printing ultimately became his favorite, for it gave him the opportunity to combine his skills of draftsmanship, carving, and printing. California's flora, fauna, and landscapes--from the Sierra Nevada to the Pacific--were the subjects that fed his creativity.</p><p><i>William S. Rice: California Block Prints</i> is the first book published on the artist's work and presents more than sixty of his color block prints dating from 1910 to 1935. Among the prints featured are scenes from Yosemite, Mt. Shasta, Monterey, Carmel, the San Francisco Bay Area, Lake Tahoe, and other California landmarks. An essay by Roberta Rice Treseder, Rice's daughter, recounts his life and achievements, with special emphasis on his block printing methods and materials.</p><p>William S.

Arlene divides her time between homes in Portland and Tillamook that she shares with her husband and their dog Navarre.</p><h2>Introducing Fascism</h2><p>Stuart Hood, distinguished British writer, broadcaster, World War II POW escapee and resistance fighter, traces the origins of fascism in the nineteenth century traditions of ultra-conservatism, and shows how the ideas of Nietzsche, Wagner and other intellectuals helped to make racist doctrines acceptable. He explores the legitimacy that these ideas gave to extreme right-wing groups in the 1930s and defines the four types of fascism that emerged at that time in Europe and Japan. Finally, he points to where and how fascism is returning today. The book is vividly illustrated by Litza Jansz.</p><p>Grade 9 Up-Presenting a strongly left-wing British view, Wood and Jansz analyze specific social movements and try to aid readers in determining which ones, if any, should be called "fascist." Continuing beyond World War II, they show that fascism is still strong in Europe. (There is no mention of any events in North America.) Using a black-and-white, comic-book format reminiscent of Rius's well-known Marx for Beginners (McKay, 1990), they lampoon their targets with considerable venom, making them appear to admit crimes they would never acknowledge in public. Readers who are knowledgeable about art will recognize some classic images (e.g., The Scream), but those without background in European history will sometimes be confused by obscure references. In contrast, Peter Chrisp's The Rise of Fascism (Watts, 1991) does an excellent job of presenting the facts in considerably greater depth and much more objectively, with plenty of contemporary photographs, maps, chronology, glossary, and index. Unfortunately, that book's coverage ends with World War II. Elaine Landau's White Power Movement (Millbrook, 1993) covers American hate groups. James Forman's Fascism (Dell, 1976) is a much more scholarly analysis, if a bit dated. Any of these titles would be preferable choices.<br><i>Jonathan Betz-Zall, Sno-Isle Regional Library System, Edmonds, WA</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mary Berry at Home</h2><p>This is Mary Berry's collection of her favorite dishes that she cooks everyday for her family and friends.

Mayo lends the oral cadence of a storyteller's voice to these tales of enchantment inhabited by unicorns, mermaids, dragons, and sea serpents. In place of the characteristic catalog of creatures, she skillfully fleshes out full stories about the phoenix rising from the ashes, the Native American Thunderbird, the Chinese dragon. Many are origin stories--the story of Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent, tells how music came to the world; a Scandinavian story about a giant sea serpent details the formation of the Orkney Islands, Iceland, and volcanoes. From the more familiar Greek myths to lesser-known Burmese folktales, heroic deeds, spells, wishes, and magic objects abound. All the stuff of imagination will engage readers and listeners alike, but those looking for happily-ever-afters will find revenge, greed, anger, and the wrath of the gods playing dramatic roles. Ray's gilded, collage-like tapestries splendidly capture these creatures of land, sea, sky, and elsewhere, in all their glory and ferocity. Framing both text and artwork are ornamental borders and sidebars decorated with motif-like shapes and images befitting the mythical qualities of the stories. (notes) (Folklore. 7-12) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Kindergarten-Grade 6. The creators of Magical Tales from Many Lands (Dutton, 1993) offer folktales and lore about mythical beasts, from unicorns, mermaids, and dragons to thunderbirds, nagas, and phoenixes. The 10 stories are from a variety of cultures and are narrated in an informal yet smooth storytelling style, often with light, effective touches of humor. Mayo makes a curious choice in her retelling of the story of the Minotaur, however; the princess Ariadne leaves Theseus due to seasickness. In most versions of the myth, Theseus abandons her under orders from one of the gods or goddesses. Mayo's source notes are virtually impeccable, incorporating information to enhance the story as well as at least one specific source for each story, except for the tale about the Minotaur. Ray's distinctive textured paintings are lush and full paged, with plenty of motifs, borders, and smaller illustrations scattered across the pages. The earthy palette adds mystery and magic to the text, and her restrained use of gold highlighting is, as always, highly effective. The large physical format with clear type and lots of white space is particularly appealing. Perfect for independent readers or reading aloud, this collection will also have wide appeal among storytellers.?Donna L.

Dolphins transmit a dream-vision to her via a eucalyptus tree that acts as an antenna; she peers through magic crystals inside her mind; encounters with hostile spirits test her spiritual powers. Among the lessons she learns are that we create our enemies within ourselves and that each of us must balance female and male energies. The narrative includes no photographs, annotations or documentation. 65,000 first printing; author tour. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.The fifth volume in the author's personal chronicle of her initiation into shamanism takes her to Australia and a secret village of "women of power" where she learns to combat real and imaginary foes and fears in the surreal time-space known as the Dreamtime. Andrews's ( Star Woman ) first-person narrative combines pop- mysticism with bits and pieces of aboriginal myth, producing a "nonfiction fantasy" that will appeal primarily to readers familiar with the author's previous titles.

Even if its sensibilities were manifestly mid-century&#x2014;the martinis, powerful male egos, and unquestioned authority of kings&#x2014;<em>GQ </em>still seemed the red-hot center of the literary world. It was there that Miller began learning how to survive in a man&#x2019;s world. Three years later, she forged her own path, becoming the first woman to take on the role of literary editor of <em>Esquire</em>, home to the male writers who had defined manhood itself&#x2014; Hemingway, Mailer, and Carver. Up against this old world, she would soon discover that it wanted nothing to do with a &#x201c;mere girl.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>But this was also a unique moment in history that saw the rise of a new literary movement, as exemplified by <em>McSweeney</em>&#x2019;s and the work of David Foster Wallace. A decade older than Miller, the mercurial Wallace would become the defining voice of a generation and the fiction writer she would work with most. He was her closest friend, confidant&#x2014;and antagonist. Their intellectual and artistic exchange grew into a highly charged professional and personal relationship between the most prominent male writer of the era and a young woman still finding her voice.&nbsp;</p><p>This memoir&#x2014;a rich, dazzling story of power, ambition, and identity&#x2014;ultimately asks the question &#x201c;How does a young woman fit into this male culture and at what cost?&#x201d; With great wit and deep intelligence, Miller presents an inspiring and moving portrayal of a young woman&#x2019;s education in a land of men.</p></p><p><strong>Adrienne Miller</strong> was the literary and fiction editor of Esquire from 1997-2006.

She lives in New York City with her husband, son, and Italian Greyhound.&#x201c;Adrienne Miller&#x2019;s voice is lucid and remorseful, and she&#x2019;s brought us a beautiful, painful book, a tender dissection of elusive subjects up to and including the passage of time and youth itself.&#x201d; (Jonathan Lethem)<br><br><em>"In The Land of Men</em>&nbsp;is about being the only woman in the room.

How one man;s courage changed the course of history</h2><p>In 1616, an English adventurer, Nathaniel Courthope, stepped ashore on a remote island in the East Indies on a secret mission - to persuade the islanders of Run to grant a monopoly to England over their nutmeg, a fabulously valuable spice in Europe. This infuriated the Dutch, who were determined to control the world&#39;s nutmeg supply. For five years Courthope and his band of thirty men were besieged by a force one hundred times greater - and his heroism set in motion the events that led to the founding of the greatest city on earth. A beautifully told adventure story and a fascinating depiction of exploration in the seventeenth century, &#34;Nathaniel&#39;s Nutmeg&#34; sheds a remarkable light on history.</p><p>Giles Milton is a writer and journalist. He has contributed articles for most of the British national newspapers as well as many foreign publications and specialises in the history of travel and exploration. In the course of his researches, he has travelled extensively in Europe and the Middle East.&#39;A magnificent piece of popular history. ... This is a book to read, reread, then read again to your children.&#39; -- Nicholas Fearn, Independent on Sunday &#39;Beautifully touching ... To write a book that makes the reader, after finishing it, sit in a trance, lost in his passionate desire to pack a suitcase and go, somehow, to the fabulous place - that, in the end, is something one would give a sack of nutmeg for.&#39; -- Philip Hensher, The Spectator &#39;Giles Milton tells his adventurous and sometimes grisly tale with relish ... The thoroughness and intelligence of his research underpins the lively confidence with which he deploys it.&#39; -- John Spurling, Times Literary Supplement &#39;Milton has created a truly gripping tale of jingoistic pride, atrocious cruelty, avarice and double-dealing ! His research is impeccable and his narrative reads in part like a modern-day Robert Louis Stevenson novel. Once embarked upon the journey of the book, one is loath, sometimes unable -- as were the characters within it -- to turn back and abandon it.&#39; -- Martin Booth, The Sunday Times</p><h2>Mary Barnes: Two Accounts of a Journey Through Madness</h2><p>For thirty years Mary Barnes was a schizophrenic. This is the story of her resurrection. <br><br>In 1966, Mary Barnes was a hopeless schizophrenic, and Joseph Berke was a young doctor rebelling against the restrictions of American psychiatry. This is the story of Barnes's resurrection, Berke's devotion, and the remarkable friendship that blossomed between them. With love and courage, they recount a tale of mutual dedication to healing without the use of psychoactive medication, chronicling how Barnes emerges from the turmoil of madness as a renowned painter. Her artistic development is beautifully illustrated in this volume as a visual analogy for the revolutionary psychic work in which she and Berke were engaged. <br><br>Told by Barnes and Berke together, the story overflows with poignancy, insight, and sensitivity. The power of this dual-voiced narrative becomes clear as the story progresses: from Barnes, we hear reflections on the subjective experience of madness and on the often arduous process of healing. From Berke, we see Barnes from the vantage point of a dedicated clinician�&#x20ac;&#x201d;the voice who, when Barnes risked becoming engulfed by her feelings of disorientation, would say "Squeeze out your badness into me." The richness afforded by this double perspective is what makes Mary Barnes's story as compelling and enthralling as it is. <br><br>Now back in print with the addition of new epilogues by both Barnes and Berke, this edition is truly complete.<br><br>"Fragmentary, onrushing, claustrophobic...A travelogue through a psychic Walpurgis Night [that] combines a personal drama of redemption from 'madness' with a profound, revolutionary statement on how a free community of souls can interact for the good of its individuals."<br>-Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, The New York Times</p><p><b>Mary Edith Barnes</b> was born in Portsmouth, England, in 1923, trained as a nurse and served as an officer with the British army in Palestine during World War II.

With three years out for service with the Coast Guard during WW II, Henrich played for the Bronx Bombers from 1937 through 1950, when a bum knee finally forced him into retirement at age 38. The hard-hitting right-fielder's championship seasons encompassed some of the sport's enduring moments, including the April day in 1939 when a dying Lou Gehrig took himself out of the lineup, ending his iron-man record at 2,130 consecutive games played. On a more personal level, Henrich was the lucky batter when Mickey Owen, the Brooklyn Dodgers catcher, dropped a third strike in the turning- point fourth game of the 1941 World Series, permitting the American League pennant winners to sweep on to the title. Propelled by memories like this, plus graceful tributes to a host of diamond personalities (Joe DiMaggio, Whitey Ford, Lefty Gomez, Johnny Mize, Don Newcombe, Phil Rizzuto, Jackie Robinson, Casey Stengel, et al.), the chronological narrative moves along at a rapid, albeit perhaps self-ingratiating, clip. Looking back with evident delight on his days as a member of memorable clubs, Henrich has harsh words for only a handful of umpires he deemed ``homers,'' head-hunting pitchers, and tight-fisted general managers who kept his annual earnings in the low five-figures range. In closing, however, Henrich makes a point of castigating George Steinbrenner for tarnishing the image of his beloved Yankees. As nice a baseball memoir as fans and nostalgia buffs are likely to find any time soon. (Eight pages of photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Together they traveled widely, entertained frequently, and raised ten children. In 1858, the celebrated writer pressured Catherine to leave their home, unjustly alleging that she was mentally disordered&#x2015;unfit and unloved as wife and mother. Constructing a plotline nearly as powerful as his stories of Scrooge and Little Nell, Dickens created the image of his wife as a depressed and uninteresting figure, using two of her three sisters against her, by measuring her presumed weaknesses against their strengths. This self-serving fiction is still widely accepted.</p><p>In the first comprehensive biography of Catherine Dickens, Lillian Nayder debunks this tale in retelling it, wresting away from the famous novelist the power to shape his wife's story. Nayder demonstrates that the Dickenses' marriage was long a happy one; more important, she shows that the figure we know only as "Mrs. Charles Dickens" was also a daughter, sister, and friend, a loving mother and grandmother, a capable household manager, and an intelligent person whose company was valued and sought by a wide circle of women and men.</p><p>Making use of the Dickenses' banking records and legal papers as well as their correspondence with friends and family members, Nayder challenges the long-standing view of Catherine Dickens and offers unparalleled insights into the relations among the four Hogarth sisters, reclaiming those cherished by the famous novelist as Catherine's own and illuminating her special bond with her youngest sister, Helen, her staunchest ally during the marital breakdown. Drawing on little-known, unpublished material and forcing Catherine's husband from center stage, <i>The Other Dickens</i> revolutionizes our perception of the Dickens family dynamic, illuminates the legal and emotional ambiguities of Catherine's position as a "single" wife, and deepens our understanding of what it meant to be a woman in the Victorian age.</p></p><p>Lillian Nayder is Professor and Chair of English at Bates College. She is the author of <i>Unequal Partners: Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins</i><i>, and</i><i> Victorian Authorship</i> and <i>The Other Dickens</i>.<p>"<i>The Other Dickens</i> breaks new ground in Victorian Studies by making Catherine, Charles Dickens's wife, the center of a work that reconfigures the Dickens story so that it is as much hers as his&#x2015;indeed more hers than his.... Nayder aims to both correct injustices done to Catherine by Charles and many of his biographers and, more crucially, to revivify Catherine&#x2019;s voice, to write her life from her own perspective.... This carefully documented, engagingly written biography manages to do justice to both."</p> (<i>Women&#x2019;s Review of Books</i>)<br><br><p>"Catherine's story, meticulously excavated here, its details saved for posterity only because of her connection to a famous man, adds valuable information to cultural and social histories of nineteenth-century women. Through Nayder's diligence in finding and analyzing the surviving materials, Catherine emerges as a quiet but engaged Victorian woman of considerable dignity and the confidence of the genteel social standing that was her birthright as a member of the Hogarth family, a social place far above her husband's when they first were married. Lillian Nayder has surely brought her to light as fully as possible in this fine and engaging study."</p> (<i>Dickens Quarterly</i>)<br><br><p>"History has not been kind to Catherine Dickens, which is why Lillian Nayder's new biography is such an essential piece of scholarship. Tracing Catherine&#x2019;s life through a wealth of letters, journals, and legal documents, Nayder takes issue with generations of biographers who have unthinkingly followed Dickens&#x2019;s lead in dismissing Catherine as a slow, clumsy, indolent figure.... The Catherine who emerges from Nayder&#x2019;s biography is, by contrast, capable, vibrant, and funny. She is a companion and an equal, a valued critic of her husband&#x2019;s work and an author (of a cookery book) in her own right."</p> (<i>Australian Book Review</i>)<br><br><p>"Lillian Nayder's sympathetic and resourceful biography pieces together Catherine's story from the records that remain, and seeks to 'wrest away from her husband the power to shape Catherine's biography.'... It is well researched, drawing on the few extant letters to her sisters and friends, the letters of others (especially Dickens), bank records and legal papers, and it tells Catherine's story neatly. Nayder is alert to the nuances of the verbal record, compelling in her reading between the lines of the fragmented voices that remain.... In May 1858, she wrote to Angela Burdett Coutts, 'One day though not now I may be able to let you know you how hardly I have been used.' Some 150 years later, Catherine's unvoiced complaint now has its fullest expression."</p> (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br><p>"Nayder redresses the notion that Catherine was a weak-willed wife and a neglectful mother, offering readers a complete, individualized portrait of her that spans the course of her life, although much of the book focuses on her married years. Making frequent use of the letters and other papers of both spouses (though not those from Catherine to Charles as he did not preserve them), Nayder illustrates how past biographers and critics have frequently misinterpreted the marriage and sustained a pro-Charles bias. The Catherine that emerges is a stronger, more organized, and more active mother than the figure portrayed before. It is exciting to speculate how this work will shape future considerations of Charles Dickens and his marriage."</p> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Nayder's vigorous biography aims to rubbish long-standing views of Catherine, dislodging her husband from center stage, resisting 'his mesmerising powers, his tendency to seize control of narratives, and his uncanny ability to make biographers speak for him from beyond the grave.'... Her book makes a powerful case that 'we may be closer to the Victorians than we think.' Modern life, Nayder suggests, retains a persistent imperative for women to see themselves as subordinate, encouraging them to submit to narratives as pernicious as those in her book. Catherine may have remained silent about her husband's conduct, but this book restores her voice as a salutary lesson to be heeded by current generations.... The 'other Dickens' of the title turns out to be not just the misunderstood and discarded heroine, but the grubby private face of this most talented of fabricators and storytellers."</p> (<i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>)<br><br><p>"Forensic in defense of Catherine and women's history, wary of the ways Dickens's biographers have characterized his wife, and extensively deploying wide original research, Lillian Nayder's justifiably partisan account recaptures Catherine's vital role in the Dickens family. The searching readings of the archive and the summoning of scientific, financial, cultural, and social evidence for the functionality and intimacy of Catherine's marriage and lasting friendships rehabilitate her. Not only that. They also force us to reconsider the dismissive accounts of her as wife and mother promulgated by Dickens and his admirers and to reassess his conception of domestic conjugality."</p> (Robert L. Patten, Lynette S. Autrey Professor in Humanities, Rice University)<br><br><p>"Lillian Nayder has accomplished what scores of literary critics and biographers have for more than a century held to be impossible: she has given us a highly readable life and times of Catherine Hogarth Dickens in which Catherine's celebrated husband, though far from playing a bit part, has been prevented from stealing the limelight."</p> (Eileen Gillooly, Columbia University)<br><br><p>"Lillian Nayder set herself the difficult task of re-creating a historical woman whose quiet, polite voice was largely drowned out by the noisier voices around her. Through resourceful uses of meticulous research, her engaging narrative succeeds in making Catherine Hogarth Dickens a sympathetic figure in her own right. Nayder embeds Catherine in her family of origin and especially in her relationships with the three sisters who played major roles in her marriage and in her life after separation from Charles Dickens."</p> (Rosemarie Bodenheimer, Boston College, author of <i>Knowing Dickens</i>)<br><br><p>"Lillian Nayder's eagerly awaited biography uses Catherine&#x2019;s voice and the voices of friends, family members, and other contemporaries to free the telling of her story from the distorting effects of its mediation by Dickens and his biographers. Catherine emerges from Nayder&#x2019;s compelling account as a much more complex figure than she has hitherto been shown to be, defined not just by her marriage to Dickens, but by other relationships and as the mistress of a substantial middle-class establishment."</p> (Catherine Waters, University of Kent, author of <i>Dickens and the Politics of the Family</i> and <i>Commodity Culture in Dickens&#x2019;s 'Household Words&#x2019;</i>)</p><h2>The New Meditation Handbook: Meditations to Make Our Life Happy and Meaningful</h2><p>With 21 easily accessible, step-by-step meditations, this fully revised resource provides readers with guidance on how to transform their daily lives, fulfill spiritual potential, and find lasting happiness.</p><p>This popular and practical manual allows us to discover for ourselves the inner peace and lightness of mind that come from meditation.

Heller, who has a doctorate in art history from Rutgers University, is a writer and lecturer on the arts who has presented numerous talks on womenartists at various museums, colleges, and other institutions. She is currently Professor of Art History at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia. Her books include The Regionalists (with Julia Williams) and North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary (co-edited with Jules Heller). Since 1984 Dr. Hellerhas been enthusiastically involved in Spanish dance as a student, teacher, writer, and lecturer.YA None of the three major surveys of art history (Jansen, Gardner, Hartt) pays adequate attention to women artists of note. Heller's book is a successful attempt to begin to remedy this gap in basic information available to lay readers about women painters and sculptors since the Renaissance. Organized in six chapters by century, the survey provides brief biographical information, some critical analysis and context, and at least one color plate of the work of 125 women artists who lived and worked in Europe or North America between the 16th Century and the 1980s. Although the prose suffers from the problems inherent in a survey texttoo much information too quickly presentedthat problem is also a strength of the volume. Readers will be fascinated to discover these relatively obscure but competent or great artists who remained unknown because they were women. The book is well designed, a pleasure to hold and read, and an excellent resource for students interested in expanding their understanding of art history.

But not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle, and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard "accidentally" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. <p> As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected?

Thomas teaches urban studies and historic preservation at the University of Pennsylvania. He is also the author of Frank Furness: The Compete Works.Regrettably, Philadelphian Price has largely eluded the attention of critics and historians. Thomas, who developed this book from a dissertation, ably corrects the oversight. Early in Price's career, country houses were the greater part of his work. After 1900, however, he designed a broader range of building types, such as hotels and buildings for industry and commerce. Because he integrated steel and reinforced concrete into his designs and used American and European arts-and-crafts sources, Price is considered a noteworthy protomodernist. In four rather inscrutably titled chapters, the author delineates Price's career and argues as well for Philadelphia's place in the history of innovative American architecture. The following catalog and chronology of his work contain ample descriptions, detailed historical data, and excellent illustrations.

Make no bones about it - you will hunt long and hard to take a good bull elk fair-and-square. And the key to your success will be what you know about elk behavior, and how you use that to your advantage in the way you hunt. That&#39;s where Bob Robb, author of Elk Essentials, comes in. His philosophy on, and commitment to, elk hunting are about as simple as you can get: know and love the animal, love the country, give them both everything you&#39;ve got; and just get out there and hunt, hunt, hunt.</p><p></p><h2>Ten Myths About Calvinism: Recovering the Breadth of the Reformed Tradition</h2><p>Historian of Christianity Ken Stewart is intent on setting the record straight about Reformed theology. He identifies ten myths held by either or both Calvinists and non-Calvinists and shows how they are gross mischaracterizations of that theological stream. Certain of these persistent stereotypes that defy historical research often present a truncated view of the depth and breadth of the Reformed tradition. Others, although erroneous, are nevertheless used to dismiss outright this rich body of biblical theological teaching. Some key questions Stewart explores in this provocative, informative and thoroughly researched book: <ul><li>Is the role reserved for John Calvin possibly exaggerated? </li><li>Are there improper, as well as proper uses of the doctrine of predestination? </li><li>To what extent is the popular acronym, T.U.L.I.P. a helpful device, and to what extent is it detrimental in encapsulating key doctrines?</li><li>Should the Calvinist position towards movements of spiritual renewal be one of support, or one of suspicion?</li><li>Didn't Calvinism more or less 'bring up the rear' in advancing the cause of world mission?</li><li>Doesn't the Calvinist approach to Christianity encourage the belief that the redeemed will be saved irrespective of their conduct?</li><li>Doesn't the Calvinist track-record show an at-best mixed legacy on critical issues such as race and gender relations?</li><li>Hasn't the Calvinist concept of the church's role vis-�-vis the state tended toward theocracy? </li><li>Isn't it true that Calvinistic expressions of Christianity have been a damper on the creative arts, whether the theater or painting or sculpture?</li></ul><em>Ten Myths About Calvinism</em> is sure to enrich both promoters and detractors, students and scholars.</p><p>Kenneth J. Stewart (PhD, University of Edinburgh) is professor of theological studies at Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, Georgia. His books include <em>Ten Myths About Calvinism</em>, <em>Restoring the Reformation</em>, and <em>The Emergence of Evangelicalism</em>. Stewart is a specialist in the history of Christianity from the Reformation to the present with special interest in the development of the evangelical Protestant tradition. He has contributed to reference works such as the <em>Dictionary of Scottish Church History and Theology</em>, <em>The Blackwell Dictionary of Evangelical Biography</em>, and the <em>Encyclopedia of the Reformed Faith.</em>"This is a book for which everyone interested in reformed theology, whether for it, against it, or simply thinking about it, would greatly benefit from reading." (Robin Weekes, Churchman, Summer 2013)<br><br>"A helpful overview of Calvinism, a reader is sure to absorb many historical tidbits and facts. Recommended." (Christine Farenhorst, Christian Renewal, June 13, 2012)<br><br>"Stewart's book is a real help in recovering the fullness of what Calvinism means, encouraging us to have less of a party spirit and instead to pursue greater unity and forbearance." (Alan D. Stranger, Mid-America Journal of Theology, Vol. 22, 2011)<br><br>"Stewart's complex retelling of the history of the Reformed movement exposes the diversity of its theology. He provides a more comprehensive understanding the very tradition that has both promoted and disproved these misinterpretations. The result of the author's careful research is a reference tool that Calvinists and non-Calvinists alike can use to prove what the Reformed tradition is, isn't, and might be. .. the dense text offers necessary perspective and self-criticism." (Publishers Weekly, January 10, 2011)<br><br>"Kenneth Stewart has written a book that should be in the hands of every Reformed pastor and teacher, especially those identifying themselves as Calvinists. This is a very important and timely book." (Charles Dunahoo, Coordinator for Christian Education, Presbyterian Church in America)<br><br>"Kenneth J. Stewart demonstrates that confusion and misapprehension reign among adherents as much, if not more, than among outsiders and opponents. . . . I find Stewart's approach refreshing; it gives me hope that both sides can be self-critical and fair as they discuss their differences." (Roger E. Olson, Christianity Today, May 2011)<br><br>"Ken Stewart's book appears at a timely moment, when Calvinism is again in vogue. Drawing on both theological and historical evidence, Ken Stewart shows that Calvinism was not the narrow, exclusive preserve of a bunch of cranks but an outward-looking, mission-orientated, vibrant and this-worldly faith. May it do its part to clear away many of the misconceptions that have bedeviled Calvinism over the years!" (Dr. David Ceri Jones, Aberystwyth University, Wales)<br><br>"Calvinism--in various strains--has been one of the most powerful forces shaping Protestant Christianity. And despite being repeatedly consigned to the dustbin of history, it just keeps bouncing back. Yet it is frequently misunderstood and misrepresented by friend and foe alike. In this richly detailed study, Ken Stewart harvests a wealth of historical research in order to bust some popular myths and reveal the dynamism and diversity of the Reformed tradition. Given the contemporary resurgence of Calvinism, this book is recommended reading for Christians who call themselves Calvinists, but also for those of us who don't." (John Coffey, University of Leicester, coeditor of The Cambridge Companion to Puritanism)<br><br>"While some may find even the word 'Calvinism' to be unhelpful, it is a standard term used by both its friends and enemies. Thus, Kenneth Stewart has done us all a service by writing a book which highlights and refutes many of the misconceptions about Calvinism propagated by both its adherents and its opponents. This book will provoke healthy and thoughtful discussions both among Reformed people and between the Reformed and Christians who belong to other traditions." (Carl R. Trueman, vice president and professor of historical theology and church history, Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia)<br><br>"This book is not only a marvelous overview of Calvinism as a many-faceted movement, it is also an excellent refresher course for those of us who consider ourselves card-carrying Calvinists. In fact, I learned many new things from reading this book--indeed, Ken Stewart even made me see that I had to change my mind about some old things!" (Richard J. Mouw, president, Fuller Theological Seminary, and author of Uncommon Decency)</p><h2>Nick Stellino&#39;s Family Kitchen</h2><p>The popular PBS-television chef presents an all new compilation of recipes and anecdotes, in a beautifully illustrated volume that introduces more than one hundred original dishes, accompanied by preparation tips and presentation suggestions. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Can it be that there are no bad cooks in Italy and Sicily? Or maybe there are only a few really good cooks, while the rest aren't so much mediocre as simply ordinary. But it's the children of the really good cooks who end up on TV cooking shows and in magazines and writing cookbooks, much like <i>Nick Stellino's Family Kitchen</i>, that skew what's real. <p> Nick Stellino has made a living in print and on TV selling the Italian family table, and this book is very much in that same vein--a little more personal, if nothing else. In often overly sentimental vignettes, Stellino shares with the reader the soul of his own family, the generations of aunts and uncles and grandparents, all of them seemingly either living in or very close to the kitchen. From this experience the reader can glean some helpful tips on how to prepare foods to cook in the Italian kitchen, how to plan meals, how to enjoy good food, and, of course, how to enjoy life: follow your dreams, follow your heart, money comes and goes but family is there forever. Stuff like that.</p><p> Stellino prides himself on presenting Italian dishes in simple, quickly assembled recipes, and that's what <i>Nick Stellino's Family Kitchen</i> is all about. The text is divided into chapters that include appetizers, soup, salad, and side dishes; pasta, entrees, desserts, basics; and menus. You'll find Braised Artichokes, Mussel Soup with Curry, Spinach Cannelloni, Chicken Scaloppine with Mushroom Sauce, Swordfish Scaloppine "Pizza Style," and Ricotta Cake with Coffee and Chocolate. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Nick Stellino is the author of: <i>Cucina Amore</i>(tm), <i>Nick Stellino's Glorious Italian Cooking</i>, and <i>Nick Stellino's Mediterranean Flavors</i>, and has been the host of more than 150 shows of public television's <i>Cucina Amore</i>(tm). Most recently he hosted <i>Nick Stellino's Dinner Party</i>, a one-hour special produced by KCTS, Seattle, and broadcast nationally on public television. He has appeared on numerous national and local television shows, including <i>Today</i>, <i>CBS This Morning</i>, HGTV, and the Pax Network, and has been featured in national publications from <i>TV Guide</i> to <i>The New York Times</i>.

Jenna's troubles finally overwhelm her when the ``Trouble of Freckles'' is added to ``Feeling Different,'' ``All Thumbs,'' and others. Then the Troublemaker takes pity, and allows Jenna to bring her troubles to swap for someone else's. The didactic ending is predictable but light enough to not be overwhelming. Cheerfully malicious, luridly-hued troubles pop out of every page, and both waif-like Jenna and the blue Troublemaker have clear definition of their own. Oram's spare text is perfectly complemented by Ross' emphatic cartoon drawings, and their theme of inadequacies accepted is one that should reach children. A funny, original book that manages to bring an old truth (and a young Jenna) home to rest.

In <em>Pick Yourself Up</em>, Charlotte Greenspan offers the most complete treatment of Fields's life and work to date, tracing her rise to prominence in a male-dominated world. Born in 1904 into a show business family--her father, Lou Fields, was a famed stage comedian turned Broadway producer--Fields first teamed with songwriter Jimmy McHugh in the late 1920s and went on to a series of Hollywood collaborations with Jerome Kern, including the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers classic <em>Swing Time</em>. With her brother Herbert, she co-authored the books for several of Cole Porter's shows and for Irving Berlin's classic <em>Annie Get Your Gun</em>. Fields's lyrics--colloquial, urbane, sometimes slangy, sometimes sensuous--won her high praise from later generations of songwriters including Stephen Sondheim, and her stellar career opened a path for other women in her profession, among them Betty Comden and Dory Previn.<br></p><p><br><strong>Charlotte Greenspan</strong> is a musicologist and pianist who has written extensively on music and film.

At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Mrs. ("The") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.<p> She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable--the big surprise comes when Matilda discovers a new, mysterious facet of her mental dexterity. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth. The reader cares about Matilda because in addition to all her other gifts, she has real feelings. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p>Roald Dahl is one of the most successful and well-known of all children's writers. His books, which are read by children the world over, include <i>James and the Giant Peach; Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; The Witches</i> and <i>Matilda.</i></p><h2>Kentuck Knob: Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s House for I.N. and Bernardine Hagan</h2><p><b>2006 IPPY Awards for independent publishers selected this book as one the top three in Architecture.</b> <p><b>The story of working with the legendary architect to build Kentuck Knob and life in this idyllic location.</b> </p><p>An unusually complete chronicle of the planning, construction, and development of the house and site, plus the experience of living in a Wright masterpiece and mecca for Wright aficionados. Includes stories, 150 b&amp;w photos, a color photo section, plans, original correspondence, and more.</p></p><p><b>A Usonian Masterpiece:</b><br> Architect Gerald Lee Morosco, AIA, a former Taliesin Fellow and Wright expert, explains in his foreword that this particular house at this time in Wright&#x2019;s career was an unusually fine success, pre-occupied as Wright was with large institutional projects such as the Guggenheim Museum. The Hagans were able to capture Wright&#x2019;s personal interest and attention, causing what could have been a minor example of his Usonian residential architecture to result in a masterpiece of the genre. <p>Kentuck Knob has been relatively unknown to the general public, even though it is located within a few miles of Fallingwater, the most famous and important house in America, and also designed by Wright. Still in private hands (although no longer in the Hagan family), Kentuck Knob is now open to the public and its fame is spreading rapidly. People who visit both houses are awed by Fallingwater, but want to live at Kentuck Knob. </p><p><b>A Mountain Home</b><br> Bernardine and I.N. Hagan embarked on the adventure of a lifetime in the early 1950s when they engaged Frank Lloyd Wright to design and build their house on a mountaintop in southwestern Pennsylvania. The Hagans were natives of the area and wanted a permanent residence, not a weekend retreat. While Wright provided a great house, it was the Hagans who made it a home. This is their journey, not just of design and construction, but also of a full life lived for over thirty years on one of the most spectacular sites in the country for a Frank Lloyd Wright house and, quite possibly, Wright&#x2019;s warmest residence. </p><p><b>250 Images: Photos, Art, and Documents. </b><br> Luckily for the reader, the author&#x2019;s husband was an accomplished amateur photographer who took thousands of photographs of Kentuck Knob from its beginnings as a denuded hilltop through its transformation into a beautiful, comfortable home with marvelously landscaped grounds. I.N. Hagan also recorded the family&#x2019;s life at Kentuck in their almost thirty years on the mountain, providing a sense of what it was like to actually live there. </p><p>Charming stories, documents, original correspondence, a color photo section, 150 black and white photos, and even a Taliesin marmalade recipe delivered by one of Wright&#x2019;s apprentices will make this a fascinating book for Wright fans everywhere.</p>Bernardine Hagan, now in her 90s, is a living legacy, one of the few people still alive who actually knew Wright. Her first-hand account reveals the process behind the creation of an architectural masterpiece and the importance of good design. Mrs. Hagan lives in Uniontown, Pennsylvania not far from her beloved Kentuck Knob, and still enjoys visits there. She remains active in helping to preserve Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2019;s legacy in the region.</p><h2>The Committed Life: An Adaptation of &#34;The Introduction to the Devout Life&#34; by St. Francis De Sales</h2><p>A masterful updating of a classic work.St. Francis de Sales (1567-1622), bishop of Geneva and founder of the Visitation Order of nuns, was renowned for his teachings on spirituality. His masterpiece in the field of spiritual literature was &#34;The Introduction to the Devout Life.&#34; Revolutionary in its day and noted for its charm, warmth, and clarity of language, it set forth a spirituality oriented toward life in the world, an approach quite different from that of St. Francis de Sales&#39;s contemporaries,who saw spiritual perfection as possible only in religious life.While the message of &#34;The Introduction to Devout Life&#34; is still valid today, the fact is that its expression is quite dated. In this book, as in &#34;Bringing &#39;The Imitation of Christ&#39; Into the 21st Cemtury,&#34; Father Meninger is not offering a new translation or paraphrase of a spiritual classic. Rather, he is attempting to express the teachings of the original in a wholly contemporary idiom. Father Meninger has not hesitated to change, omit, or add to the original where necessary, the better to highlight the heart and charisma of St. Francis de Sales&#39;s teachings.</p><p>William A.

Each entry includes a synopsis of the work as well as publication history, biographical information about the author of each title, and recommended reading and biographical notes on the contributor. Author Ramsey Campbell also offers a new foreword to the book describing the evolution of horror over the past two decades &#x2014; from the way it's written by a crop of new and exciting writers to the way it's received by a new market of readers. Horror: Another 100 Best Books will be the definitive guide to the tremendous library of horror fiction available today &#x2014;a reference that no fan can live without.</p><p>In his foreword, Peter Straub says this -follow-up to <i> Horror: 100 Best Books</i> (1988) arrives when "a sophisticated contemporary reader" is more likely to consider genre fiction than ever before. Of course, horror isn't really a genre but, as Neil Gaiman says, a condiment that can improve any kind of literary dish. That seems to account for this round of 100 horror classics containing several books not thought of as horror (e.g., <i> Highsmith's Talented Mr. Ripley</i>, Fowles' <i> Collector</i>, Camus' <i> Stranger</i>) and by writers not considered horror hands (e.g., Bret Easton Ellis, Patrick McGrath). Still, most choices readily fit into the horror category, though their primary associations are to the detective, sf, crime, gothic, and fantasy genres; to hybrid forms like the musical (<i>Sweeney Todd</i>) and graphic novel (<i>From Hell</i>); and to the literary mainstream (<i>American Psycho</i>). Horror fans seeking what to read next will not only find out here; they'll also have their taste and appreciative capacity refined by the intelligent, passionate commentary of the 100 writers who selected these 100 books. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>In this worthy sequel to Horror: 100 Best Books (1988), prolific anthologist Jones (Shadows Over Innsmouth) and novelist Newman (Anno Dracula) have gathered 100 appreciative short essays on landmark horror titles by today's top writers and critics in the genre, from Robert Silverberg on Cyril de Tourneur's The Revenger's Tragedy (1607) to Tim Lebbon on Michael Marshall Smith's More Tomorrow &amp; Other Stories (2003). Any work that inspires fear was fair game for selection, as evidenced by entries on such classics as Charlotte Bront�'s Jane Eyre, George Gissing's New Grub Street and George Orwell's 1984. Like its predecessor, this volume contains plenty of lively and candid commentary, such as British screenwriter Christopher Wicking's insider's view of the pitiful efforts to adapt H.P. Lovecraft to film in his piece on Lovecraft's The Case of Charles Dexter Ward.

And when acts of sabotage threaten both the family business and the family itself, Sophia&#x2019;s quest will be not only for dominance, but also for survival.</p><p>Set in beautiful Napa Valley, California, Nora Roberts's latest novel portrays a rich world of family-owned wineries, complete with enough romance, sophisticated business intrigue, betrayal, and murder to cow the Medicis of Florence. <i>The Villa</i> focuses on the merger of two prominent winemaking families, the Giambellis and MacMillans, and the incendiary combination of the two upcoming leaders of those dynasties, Sophia Giambelli and Tyler MacMillan. Tyler is the manager of the MacMillan vines and the distilling process, a job that suits his frank and no-frills personality. Creative and flashy, Sophia is head of Giambelli's public relations, and her job has been to put the best spin on whatever her family business produces--hard to do when the merger requires that she and Tyler switch jobs, and particularly hard to do when her own heart seems to spin out of control whenever they're together.<p> Soon after the merger goes through, Tyler and Sophia learn that they have bigger problems than their conflicting work styles. Tony Avano, a Giambelli executive and Sophia's father, is murdered, and threats surface against the Giambelli women. As a quiet woman, Sophia's mother, Pilar, has made few enemies, except for Tony's new wife, Rene. The matriarch of the family--known simply as La Signora--may have knocked some rivals aside as she clawed her way to the top, but few would have reason to threaten her now. When poison is discovered in Giambelli wine, Sophia and Tyler learn the killer is much closer than they thought.</p><p> In description, dialogue, and plot, Roberts's talent and control are as fine as ever. But while the relationship between Pilar and David, the new COO, feels complex and mature, Sophia and Tyler's romance can at times feel slightly forced. As Roberts explains repeatedly, Sophia approaches sex "as a man does," which apparently means with no strings attached. And while that does tend to take the "romance" out of the romance to some extent, the positive aspects to be found in <i>The Villa</i> outweigh this flaw, ensuring another hit for the talented and prolific Roberts. <i>--Nancy R.E. O'Brien</i></p>Sophia Giambelli has never had to worry about competition.

His chief work, Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, first published in 1817, had a profound impact and remains one of the groundworks of modern economics. Ricardo&#39;s labor theory of value, as well as his elaboration of the division of incomes, and the function of wages, rent, and trade, deeply influenced the economic philosophies of Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, Alfred Marshall, and many others.</p><p><b>David Ricardo&nbsp;</b>(1772-1823) was a British political economist, born in London.&nbsp;Ricardo was a political contemporary of Thomas Malthus, James Mill, and Adam Smith, with the latter&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Wealth of Nations&nbsp;</i>serving as a chief inspiration for his economic studies.

Tensions mount in the aftermath of the rebel victory in New York. Charlotte&#x2019;s father supports the rebel Patriots and has broken all ties with the Empire. A stubborn man, he even shuns his own brother, a Loyalist. Forbidden to see her cousins who are only hours away from their departure for what would become Canada, Charlotte must make a difficult decision.</p><p><b>Janet Lunn</b> is one of the most admired writers of children. Her many honors, national and international, include the Vicky Metcalf Award for Body of Work, the Governor General&#x2019;s Literary Award, and The Canadian Library Association Book of the Year Award.Gr. 4^-6, younger for reading aloud. Based on a true story, this unusual picture book takes readers back to New York City in 1783. Ten-year-old Charlotte has a dilemma. Her father, who supported the colonists during the Revolution, feuds with his brother, a Loyalist. He has forbidden Charlotte to speak with her uncle, aunt, and cousins. Now that the war is over, Loyalists are being transported to Nova Scotia. Charlotte slips away from the slave who escorts her to school and runs off to say goodbye to her beloved relatives. When she returns home, her father bars her way at the gate, saying, "You have made your choice. I never wish to see your traitorous face again." Shaken, Charlotte returns to her aunt and uncle, who take her to live with them in Canada. An afterword briefly tells what happened to Charlotte Haines, who never saw her father, mother, or brother again. Illustrated with luminous paintings of dramatic scenes, this book looks accessible to young children, but that age group may be frightened by the fact that a child could be banished from her home and country for a single act of disobedience. The book will be more meaningful to middle-graders, who may find Charlotte's punishment a shock, but will at least know something about the period. They will certainly learn more here. Slaves in the North? Loyalists shipped off to Canada? Banishment of children? This dramatic story is a far cry from the usual Revolutionary War tale in which children perform small, quiet acts of bravery in the patriotic cause. Intriguing and emotionally wrenching, this provides clear-cut depictions of good and evil. And if the American patriot is the villain for a change, that in itself is a matter for discussion. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Greening Death: Reclaiming Burial Practices and Restoring Our Tie to the Earth</h2><p>We once disposed of our dead in earth-friendly ways&#x2014;no chemicals, biodegradable containers, dust to dust. But over the last 150 years death care has become a toxic, polluting, and alienating industry in the United States.<br><br>Today, people are slowly waking up to the possibility of more sustainable and less disaffecting death care, reclaiming old practices in new ways, in a new age. Greening Death traces the philosophical and historical backstory to this awakening, captures the passionate on-the-ground work of the Green Burial Movement, and explores the obstacles and other challenges getting in the way of more robust mobilization. As the movement lays claim to greener, simpler, and more cost-efficient practices, something even more promising is being offered up&#x2014;a tangible way of restoring our relationship to nature.</p><p>Suzanne Kelly, PhD, is an independent scholar whose work spans the topics of the environment, feminism, sex, and death. She writes and farms in New York&#x2019;s Hudson Valley.Kelly writes engagingly on this exceedingly timely topic: how funerary rites are affected by the burgeoning environmental movement. Through conversations with people in the field, she explains what a green burial is and how specific aspects of traditional funerals, from embalming to caskets, liners, and vaults conflict with its ecological ideals. But more than just technical aspects and logistics, including regulations, Kelly also tackles the complexities of cultural perspectives on death and the desire for guidance pertaining to alternative funerary practices even beyond cremation. She weighs in with personal experiences and frustrations over the challenge to honor tradition when no one knows what the new tradition should be, providing a welcome balance for her coverage of more practical topics. Changing how we care for the dead, she notes, means 'restoring our relationship to the land.' Interestingly, some things about today&#x2019;s choices are not so modern after all, but in fact return to practices that were once understood as the right things to do. A useful and highly readable title that serves a valuable purpose in our complicated times. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>In her new book Greening Death, author Suzanne Kelly explores the myths that drive many of our standard, environmentally damaging burial practices. Kelly unpacks the funeral industry's environmentally destructive and alienating methods and gives voice to a growing movement seeking to reckon with decay and restore lost knowledge to the living. Detailing how embalming and encasing the dead in caskets and then in grave-lining vaults have little to do with limiting health risks or ensuring adequate sanitation, Kelly argues that these practices are not only destructive to the environment, but worse, they dishonor the necessity of dissolution, while reinforcing human beings' separation from nature. But this is changing. A movement to green death is gathering momentum, and Kelly is one of its most ardent allies. (<i>Truthout</i>)<br><br>Greening Death is a noble book, reminding us of the simple, often heartfelt rites of centuries past. (<i>RALPH: The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy, and the Humanities</i>)<br><br>Readers of Omegaunderstand the importance of hands-on activity in walking through the grief process and Kelly does a fine job of paving a way for that to begin during the chaos of early grief. (<i>Omega - Journal of Death and Dying</i>)<br><br>Far more than an exploration of green burials, Greening Death is an elegant and important exploration of how we can begin to give back to the earth. (Derrick Jensen, author of Endgame)<br><br>The first book to get under the covers of an increasingly important environmental/ social/ consumer movement. Suzanne Kelly not only tells thought provoking stories of those working to make green burial a viable option, she connects their efforts to some of the greatest eco-thought leaders of the past century. By far the most engaging examination of the our culture's growing desire to integrate death and life. (Joe Sehee, founder of Green Burial Council)<br><br>In these strange times, when we are rapidly running out of room and resources, most of us can agree that burying our loved ones is unsustainable. But what other options exist? Kelly lays out the possibility of burial practices that change our relationship to nature, respect the earth, and honor decay as a form of interconnectedness. Linking burial practices to feminist theory, this beautifully written book belongs in the hands of everyone who seeks a better way to live and die. (Kathy Rudy, Professor of Women&#x2019;s Studies, Duke University)<br><br>A scholar who successfully led a community's efforts to establish a green cemetery, Suzanne Kelly has written the most insightful, provocative, and important account of the North American recovery of natural burial. Richly informed by feminist environmental philosophy, Kelly brilliantly unfolds the wisdom of the human body's membership in the community of the land, coming to profound and compelling expression in burial practice. This book is about death, but it is a poetic guide to where we hope to live: a green, flourishing earth on which humans are at home. (Benjamin M. Stewart, PhD, Gordon A. Braatz Associate Professor of Worship, The Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago)<br><br>Kelly presents an intelligent, considered appeal for breaking the cultural silence about the environmental toll of human death; an appeal for an earth-based ethic of human death that I whole-heartedly support! As Kelly eloquently reminds us, its paramount that we let decay have its place in our human mortuary practices if we are to foster a sustainable future on this planet. Her suggestions on how to cultivate and practice an earth-based ethic of human death that includes disenfranchised human communities is an invaluable contribution to death studies and fostering the future of the green burial movement.

Botticelli gave stunning visual form to the poet&#39;s epic journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise, but the project was never completed and the sheets were scattered. Now, more than 500 years after their creation, all 91 existing -- and very fragile -- vellum sheets will be shown together for the first time, in Berlin, Rome, and London. This book, which accompanies the exhibition, illustrates each of Botticelli&#39;s canto sheets in superb color, faced by a commentary on Botticelli&#39;s pictorial response to Dante&#39;s poem by Hein-Thomas Schulze Altcappenberg of the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin, where 84 of the sheets are permanently housed. Eight essays on Botticelli, the Medici, and the Divine Comedy complete this unprecedented volume.</p><p>The Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli is probably best known for <i>Birth of Venus</i> and <i>Primavera</i>, two commissions for the young Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. The same delicate, rhythmic line and fanciful imagination can be found in another project for this patron: an unfinished set of drawings from the 1480s that illustrate <i>The Divine Comedy</i>, Dante's chronicle of his vividly imagined travels through the Inferno and Purgatory to Paradise.<p> For those familiar with the jewel-like colors of Botticelli's paintings, it may come as a shock that many of the 92 drawings that survive are very faint preliminary sketches. (They were made with a metal point on sheep parchment, sometimes touched up with pen and ink. A few have been colored in.) But just as the poet Virgil serves as the 35-year-old epic hero's indispensable guide, the astute running commentary in this book helps modern readers perceive how Botticelli subtly evokes the hero's feelings. "Botticelli's Dante is guided above all by his eyes," writes Hein-Thomas Schulze Altcappenberg, chief curator of Berlin's Kupferstichkabinett. "[They] are literally opened in proportion to his enlightenment, until his vision ultimately dissolves in an image of pure beauty, liberated from constraints of time and space." </p><p> By showing multiple views of the characters in a single drawing, Botticelli portrays Dante's successive reactions to what he sees and Virgil's responses to his charge's state of mind. And by giving every group of doomed souls a distinctive gesture or expression, he follows the poet's lead in illuminating both the individual and the universal. Published to accompany the exhibition of the same title that has been shown in Berlin and Rome and continues at the Royal Academy of Arts in London through June 2001, this book represents a triumph of accessible scholarship, intelligent design, and deeply rewarding content. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p>Between 1480 and 1495, Botticelli executed a series of almost 100 drawings on vellum sheets, each based on individual cantos of Dante's Divine Comedy. It is almost certain that these exquisite and enigmatic works now hanging in the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin and in the Vatican were done for an unfinished manuscript intended for the artist's great patron, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. All of these drawings, which are being shown together for the first time, and a significant body of comparative material are gathered in this superbly illustrated and fully documented exhibition catalog. Each drawing is accompanied by a cogent summary of its canto along with an acute analysis of the drawing's formal construction, all by Kupferstichkabinett chief curator Altcappenberg. Emphasis is also given to the relationships among the drawings and to Botticelli's creative response to the cantos. There is, in addition, a helpful and informative coda of seven scholarly essays by German and Italian scholars and curators on themes surrounding the project. Art libraries should seriously consider the acquisition of this important volume.

She lives in Australia.1: WOLF<br><br>A SHEPHERD was gathering firewood by the old Pellinor Road when a strange sight caught his attention. A horseman dressed in black, mounted on a magfinicent black horse, was trotting briskly along the disused course�a clear, small figure in the pale winter sunshine. To see a stranger at all was noteworthy. Since the sack of the School of Pellinor ten years before and the bad times that had followed, few travelers came this way. The days when Bards and merchants had ridden easily to Pellinor, making the road bright with their fine clothes and singing, had vanished so completely they now seemed like a time of legend. But the sight of a stranger, even one so ominously cloaked, was not what made the old man clutch his bundle of faggots to his chest and step warily behind a thicket of brambles, fearfully making the sign against the evil eye. His eyes were fixed on the beast that accompanied the rider: a large, white dog. If it was a dog, that is. It was like no dog the shepherd had seen. It was taller than a calf, and seemed bigger because of its thick winter pelt, which stood out around its head like a ruff. It kept pace effortlessly with the horse, running at an easy lope that revealed the strong muscles of its shoulders and haunches. If it hadn't been with the rider, the old man would have thought it a wolf; but he had never heard that a wolf would run with a horse. As the strange trio came nearer, the shepherd's heart chilled and he crouched down behind the brambles, his hands trembling. His eyesight wasn't what it was, but he knew a wolf when he saw one. He began to regret having strayed so close to the road, even on so fair a day, and all the rumors he had heard of uncanny events, of evil creatures and dark sorcerers crowded into his head at once. If anything should happen to him, his wife would never know; and she would be quite alone, as their son had left the hamlet, looking for a better life. The shepherd crouched closer to the ground, hoping he would remain unnoticed, and held his breath as the hoofbeats came closer and closer. To his alarm, they slowed to a walk; and then they stopped altogether. <br>"Where is he, Maerad?" A man's voice rang clear on the cold air, although he spoke in a low voice. <br>Even though he was so frightened, the old man was confused: to whom was the stranger speaking? He had seen no other with him. Did he converse, as the black witches were said to do, with spirits of the air? The shepherd held his breath, clutching his bundle of faggots so tightly to his chest that his knuckles were white. <br>"Over there, you think?" <br>The shepherd heard the man dismount and begin to walk toward him. In his agitation, the old man dropped his firewood with a clatter that to him sounded like thunder. He turned to run, but tripped over a tussock and fell over. As he scrambled onto his hands and knees, he found himself face-to-face with the wolf, and groaned in terror. Instinctively he hid his face in his hands, so he should not see his own death. <br>But he did not feel the wolf's teeth meeting in his neck, as he had expected. Instead, the stranger was speaking to him. At first the shepherd was too terrified to hear what he said. <br>"I beg your forgiveness," the stranger was saying. "I swear by the Light that we mean you no harm." <br>Slowly, the shepherd took his hands from his face. There was no sign of the wolf, and instead the stranger was standing before him, offering his hand. He helped the old man to his feet and gently brushed down his jerkin. Then he silently picked up the firewood and carefully heaped it in the shepherd's arms. The old man regained his breath. The stranger had a kindly look; but there was something else about him, an air of grace, that reminded the shepherd of better days. It had been a long time since his kind had been seen here. <br>He thanked the stranger gravely, in the formal way he once would have thanked a Bard who did him some healing or said the spring rites over a crop. The other gave him a sharp look. <br>"It's been many years since I've seen a Bard around here," said the old man. Now that his fright was over, he wanted to talk. <br>"There is little reason to come," said the stranger. His eyes met the old man's, and they both looked away at the same instant, as if reading in each other's faces a sadness they didn't wish to name. <br>"Does this mean that the School of Pellinor will come back? Will there be Bards again?" <br>The Bard hesitated. "I don't know," he said. <br>The shepherd shifted the firewood, as it was getting heavy. "I am hoping that they do," he said at last. "It's hard with them gone. The winters bad and the lambs born awry and all else gone wrong." <br>"Aye," said the Bard. "Much else, and not only here. These are hard times for many people." <br>The shepherd nodded, and sniffed unhappily. But the stranger reached forward and touched his brow briefly, and for a moment it was as if a soft sun bloomed in the old man's forehead, and spread its golden warmth through his whole body. <br>"The Light go with you," said the Bard. <br>"And with you," answered the shepherd, in the proper way. He watched as the stranger walked back to his horse, which stood patiently on the road awaiting its rider. The white wolf sat on its haunches by the horse, looking no more dangerous than a big puppy. The Bard mounted, raised his hand in farewell, and rode away. It was only then that the old man realized that he hadn't asked his name. <br>He didn't stay to watch the horseman vanish in the distance. His wife would be waiting. The warmth from the Bard's touch still ran through his veins, and he hummed an old song as he walked home. His step was light: for the first time since he could remember, hope stirred in his heart...</p><h2>On the Far Side of Liglig Mountain</h2><p><p>On the Far Side of Liglig Mountain is a book that will take you lands away to the mysterious "closed" kingdom of Nepal, where its author, Thomas Hale, and his wife, Cynthia, have struggled to serve God as medical doctors. With beguiling humor and humility, Dr. Hale recounts his often amazing (and sometimes almost unbelievable) experiences in bringing western medicine to people who distrust -- even fear -- the introduction of ideas different from their own. He and his family work as a team to dispel that distrust and fear, and in the process have experienced incredible adventures. On the Far Side of Liglig Mountain is a book about - faith and courage - laughter and loving your neighbor - the hardships and the blessings of self-denial -- a book that you will not easily lay aside. Just as he has gained the trust and affection of his Nepalese patients and neighbors by his love for people and his eagerness to share his love of Christ, Thomas Hale will captivate the reader with his intriguing account of the joys and realities of ministering to the human condition.</p></p><p>In 1970, Thomas Hale and his wife, Cynthia, went to Nepal to work for their first twelve years at a rural mission hospital in the village of Amp Pipal. Subsequently they moved to Kathmandu, Nepal&#39;s capital city, where they have continued their work with the mission. Recently Cynthia took a position as an associate professor at Nepal&#39;s only medical school, and Tom has written a one-volume commentary on the New Testament, first in Nepali and subsequently in English for translation into other languages.</p><h2>The Gun Digest Black Powder Loading Manual</h2><p>450 loads for 86 of the most popular black powder rifles, handguns and shotguns.

There he meets an old man who accuses him of being an imposter, and then a being from Neptune who claims to be an old friend. The Neptunian tells him that essential parts of his memory were removed and stored by the very government that Phaethon believes to be wholly honorable. It shakes his faith. Is he indeed an exile from himself? He can&#x2019;t resist investigating, even though to do so could mean the loss of his inheritance, his very place in society. His quest must be to regain his true identity and fulfill the destiny he chose for himself.<br><br><i>The Golden Age</i> is just the beginning of Phaethon&#x2019;s story, which will continue in <i>The Phoenix Exultant</i>, forthcoming from Tor.<br></p><p><i>The Golden Age</i> is the most ambitious and impressive science fiction novel since China Mi�ville's <i>Perdido Street Station</i>.

A trusting son of this future, Phaethon of Radamanthus House, discovers the rulers of the solar system have erased entire centuries from his mind. When he attempts to regain his lost memories, the whole society of the Golden Oecumene opposes him. Like his mythical namesake, Phaethon has flown too high and been cast down. He has committed the one act forbidden in his utopian universe. Now he must find out what it is--and who he is.</p><p> A novel influenced by Roger Zelazny, Jack Vance, and A.E. van Vogt, yet uniquely itself, <i>The Golden Age</i> presents a complex and thoroughly imagined future that will delight science fiction fans. John C. Wright has a gift for big, bold concepts and extrapolations, and his smoothly written novel pushes cyberpunk's infotech density to a new level, while abandoning cyberpunk's nihilistic <i>noir</i> tone for SF's original optimism. Big ideas are joined by big themes; Wright provocatively explores the nature of heroism, the nature of power, and the conflict between the rights of the individual and those of society.</p><p> Fiction as ambitious as <i>The Golden Age</i> is never flawless. Action fans will find this novel too talky. A change of quests late in the novel is jarring. And, while this <i>Romance of the Far Future</i> suitably examines the heroic virtues, its unfortunate subtext is "heroism is a guy thing." This far-future novel published in 2002 maintains a credulity-shattering mid-20th-century sexual status quo.</p><p> Not all plotlines are resolved in <i>The Golden Age</i>, and a sequel is forthcoming. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>John C.

He showed me the harpoon and a dead fly. &#x201c;I quit because it was very hard work and very poorly rewarded,&#x201d; he explained as he packed the tools of his former trade back into a lacquered box. &#x201c;Now I open garages. It&#x2019;s a lot of work, but it&#x2019;s very well rewarded.&#x201d;<br> <br>During the first period of the first day of school, when everyone introduces themselves, I spoke, with no small amount of pride, about my father&#x2019;s professions, but all it got me was some gentle scolding and copious teasing. &#x201c;The truth is poorly rewarded, when for once it was as entertaining as a lie,&#x201d; I lamented. My father was actually a man of the law. &#x201c;The law puts food on our table!&#x201d; he guffawed as he filled his pipe.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>He was neither a judge, nor a legislator, nor a debt collector, nor a lawyer&#x2014;nothing like that. Thanks to inside information about the provisions of a new law, he was the first person to step into a new profession created out of thin air by the Senator. And that&#x2019;s how my father became a &#x201c;garage opener.&#x201d; New rules mean new jobs. To make sure the nation&#x2019;s fleet of cars was safe and sound, the Senator decreed that everyone would have to pass inspection. Owners of jalopies, limousines, vans, and rattletraps alike had to take their vehicles for a checkup to avoid accidents. Rich or poor, everyone had to do it. Since it was mandatory, he inevitably charged a lot for it, a small fortune. He charged for entering and for exiting, for the initial inspection and the follow-ups, and judging by his laughter, that was fine with him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m saving lives, I&#x2019;m saving lives!&#x201d; he&#x2019;d chuckle, as he flipped through his bank statements.<br> <br>Back then, saving lives paid very well. After he opened a lot of garages, he sold them to the competition, which was a relief for Mom. She didn&#x2019;t really care for his saving lives, because it meant he worked so much that we hardly ever saw him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m working late so I can stop early,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d reply, which I didn&#x2019;t really understand. I often didn&#x2019;t understand my father. I did a little more as the years went by, but never completely. Which was fine with me.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>He had told me he was born that way, but when I was still pretty young, I realized that the ashy, slightly swollen indentation on the right side of his lower lip, which gave him a nice, somewhat twisted smile, was actually due to diligent pipe smoking. His hairstyle&#x2014;parted in the middle with little waves on either side&#x2014;reminded me of the Prussian cavalry officer in the painting in the front hall. Aside from the two of them, I&#x2019;d never seen anyone whose hair looked like that. His slightly hollow eye sockets and lightly bulging blue eyes gave him a curious gaze, deep and wise. Back then, I only ever saw him happy, and in fact, he often used to say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a happy fool!&#x201d;<br> <br>To which my mother would reply, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll take your word for it, George, we&#x2019;ll take your word for it!&#x201d;<br> <br>He would hum, badly, all the time. Sometimes he&#x2019;d whistle, just as badly, but like anything that&#x2019;s done cheerfully, it was bearable. He told great stories, and on those rare evenings when we didn&#x2019;t have any company, he would fold his tall, lean body onto my bed for a bedtime story. He&#x2019;d begin with a grin, then his tale of a jinn, a leprechaun, a twin or a peppercorn would chase all my sleepiness away. Things usually wound up with me jumping up and down with excitement on my bed, or hiding, terrified, behind the curtains. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a very tall story for such a little boy,&#x201d; he would say as he slipped out of my room. And once again, you could take his word for it.<br> <br>On Sundays, to make up for the week&#x2019;s excesses, he would pump iron. Standing in front of the big mirror with its fancy gilt frame topped with a majestic bow, he would strip to the waist and, pipe in mouth, lift tiny little barbells while listening to jazz music. He called that his &#x201c;gym &amp; tonic&#x201d; because he&#x2019;d pause to gulp a gin &amp; tonic and tell my mother, &#x201c;You should get some exercise, Miss Daisy, I&#x2019;m telling you, it&#x2019;s fun, and you feel great afterward!&#x201d;<br> <br>To which my mother, who was trying&#x2014;one eye closed, tongue sticking out in concentration&#x2014;to spear the olive in her martini with the little paper parasol, would reply, &#x201c;You should try orange juice, George. I swear that exercise wouldn&#x2019;t be nearly as much fun with OJ instead of G &amp; T. And would you be so kind, monsieur, as to cease calling me Daisy forthwith? Pick another name, or else I&#x2019;m going to start mooing like a heifer!&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>I never really understood why, but my father never called my mother by the same name for more than a day or two in a row. Even though she tired of some names sooner than others, she loved the ritual, and every morning in the kitchen, I could see her watching my father with excited anticipation, holding her coffee cup or her chin in her hands as she awaited the verdict. &#x201c;Oh no, you wouldn&#x2019;t do that to me! Not Renee, not today! We&#x2019;ve got company coming for dinner tonight!&#x201d; she would giggle. Then she&#x2019;d turn to the mirror and greet the new Renee with a pout, the new Josephine with a regal gaze, the new Marylou with puffed-out cheeks. &#x201c;Besides, there&#x2019;s absolutely nothing Renee-like about my wardrobe!&#x201d;<br> <br>There was just one day a year when my mother always had the same name: on February 15, her name was Georgette. It still wasn&#x2019;t her real name, but Saint Georgette&#x2019;s Day was the day after Saint Valentine&#x2019;s Day. My parents didn&#x2019;t think it was very romantic to be seated at a table in a restaurant filled with mandatory, predictable professions of love on Valentine&#x2019;s Day. So each year, they would celebrate on Saint Georgette&#x2019;s Day, and enjoy an almost empty restaurant with the staff dancing attendance on them alone. Besides, Dad thought that a romantic festivity had to have a woman&#x2019;s name. &#x201c;Please reserve your best table in the name of George and Georgette. And can you promise me that you don&#x2019;t have any of those awful heart-shaped desserts left? None? Thank the Lord!&#x201d; he would say as he booked a table at a fancy restaurant. For them, Saint Georgette&#x2019;s was no time to act like marionettes.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>After the business with the garages, my father didn&#x2019;t have to get up in the morning to put food on the table anymore, so he started writing books. All the time. A lot of them. He would sit at his big desk, writing, laughing as he wrote, writing down what made him laugh, filling his pipe, the ashtray and the room with smoke and the paper with ink, while emptying cups of coffee and whole bottles of mixed drinks. But the publishers&#x2019; replies were all the same: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s clever and well written, but we can make neither heads nor tails of it.&#x201d; To cheer him up after the rejections, my mother would say, &#x201c;Why would anyone want to make heads or tails out of a book? What a strange idea!&#x201d; That always cracked us up.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>My father used to say that Mom was on a first-name basis with the stars in the sky, which seemed strange, because my mother never called anyone by their first name&#x2014;not even me. Nor did my mother ever call our pet demoiselle crane by a pet name. The elegant and surprising bird lived in our apartment, parading her undulating long black neck, white plumes jutting from her violently red eyes. My parents had brought her back from a journey to I-don&#x2019;t-know-where, from their life before me.<br> <br>We called her Mademoiselle Superfluous, because she served no purpose, except for squawking loudly for no reason at every season, leaving round pyramids on the parquet floor, and waking me up in the middle of the night by tap-tap-tapping on my bedroom door. Like my father&#x2019;s stories, Mademoiselle was very tall, even with her head tucked under her wing to sleep. As I child, I used to try to copy her, but it was pretty tricky.<br> <br>Mademoiselle loved when Mom would lie on the couch to read and pet her head for hours on end. Like all wise birds, Mademoiselle loved reading. One day my mother decided to take Mademoiselle Superfluous shopping in town. She made her a lovely pearl leash, but Mademoiselle was so spooked by the sight of all those people&#x2014;and so many people were spooked by the sight of Mademoiselle&#x2014;that she squawked louder than ever. An old lady with a dachshund even said that it was inhuman and dangerous to walk a bird down the street on a leash. &#x201c;Feathers or fur, what difference does it make?&#x201d; Mom asked. &#x201c;Mademoiselle has never bitten anyone, and it seems to me that she&#x2019;s far more elegant than your fuzzy hot dog! Come, Mademoiselle Superfluous, let&#x2019;s go home; people here are so discourteous!&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom got home in high dudgeon that day. When she was in that state, she would find my father to relate the whole story to him in great detail. She wouldn&#x2019;t go back to being her usual jovial self until after she&#x2019;d finished. She got upset easily, but my father would resolve things breezily. His voice was very soothing to her. The rest of the time, she was rapturous about everything, found the world&#x2019;s progress thrilling, and skipped along with it joyfully.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t treat me like an adult, or like a child, more like a character from a book that she loved very dearly, and that could absorb all her attention in an instant. She never wanted to hear about trials or tribulations. &#x201c;When reality is sad or mundane, make up a lovely story, young man,&#x201d; she would say. &#x201c;You tell such beautiful falsehoods, it would be such a shame to deprive us.&#x201d; So I would make up a story about my day, and when I was done, she would clap her hands and giggle, &#x201c;What a fabulous day, my darling son, what a day. I&#x2019;m so happy for you, young man, you must have had such a wonderful time!&#x201d; Then she would hug me tight and kiss me. She was nibbling me, she would say. I loved when she nibbled me. Every morning, after receiving her daily name, she would give me one of her freshly scented gloves, so that her hand could guide me all day long.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>&#x201c;Some of her features bore traces of her childlike manner: apple cheeks and green eyes that sparkled with mischief. The shimmering barrettes she used to tame her lioness&#x2019;s mane granted her the elfin sassiness of a late-blooming Plain Jane. But her bee-stung crimson lips miraculously held her precariously perched slim white cigarettes, and her long eyelashes, measuring the world up, showed the beholder that she had grown up. Her outfits, slightly extravagant and extremely elegant&#x2014;at least in how they were put together&#x2014;proved to observant eyes that she had lived, had known some stormy weather.&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what my father had written in a secret notebook that I read later, afterward. While it may not have had a tail, it definitely had a head.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>My parents danced all the time, and all over the place. With their friends in the evening; just the two of them morning, noon and night. Sometimes I danced with them. They were totally footloose and fancy-free, knocking over anything in their path, my father flinging my mother into space, catching her by her fingernails after a pirouette or two, or even three. He would swing her between his legs, twirl her around him like a weather vane, and when he accidentally let her slip from his grasp, Mom would wind up plopped on the floor with her dress fanned out around her like a teacup on a saucer.<br> <br>When they danced, they would shake up amazing cocktails, with paper umbrellas, olives, spoons and whole collections of bottles. On the living-room couch, in front of a huge black-and-white snapshot of Mom diving into a pool in an evening gown, there was a lovely old-fashioned turntable that always played the same Nina Simone album, and the same song: &#x201c;Mr. Bojangles.&#x201d; It was the only record that was allowed to turn on that table; all other music had to settle for a newer, drabber stereo. The song was truly crazy, happy and sad at the same time, and it would put my mother in the same mood. It lasted a long time, but always ended too soon, and my mother would clap her hands excitedly and shout, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s play &#x2018;Bojangles&#x2019; again!&#x201d; Then you had to grasp the arm and set the diamond needle back on the edge. Only a diamond could produce music like that.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Our apartment was very big, so that we could have lots and lots of company. The front hall was tiled with big black-and-white squares that formed a huge checkerboard. My father bought forty black and white cushions, and after school, we would have gigantic checkers parties under the watchful eye of the Prussian cavalier. He was the referee, but he never said anything. Sometimes Mademoiselle Superfluous disrupted the game, pushing the white cushions around with her head or stabbing them with her beak. Only the white ones; we didn&#x2019;t know if it was because she didn&#x2019;t like them or because she loved them too much. We never did find out. Like everyone, Mademoiselle had her secrets.<br> <br>In one corner of the hall, there was a mountain of mail that my parents had tossed on the floor unopened. The mountain was so huge that I could toss myself onto it without getting hurt. Warm and welcoming, it was part of the furniture. Sometimes my father would say, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re a bad boy, you&#x2019;re going to have to open all that mail and sort it!&#x201d; But he never made me do it; he didn&#x2019;t have a mean bone in his body.<br> <br>The living room was a real madhouse. There were two bloodred club chairs for my parents to sit and drink in; a glass table filled with sand of every color; and a huge blue couch that was very plump and meant to be jumped on: my mother recommended it highly. Sometimes she would jump with me. I would cheer when she jumped so high that she touched the glittering crystal chandelier. My father was right: if she wanted to, she really could call the stars by their first names.<br> <br>Facing the couch, resting on an old trunk covered with stickers from cities around the world, was a musty old television set that didn&#x2019;t work very well. All the channels showed images of anthills in gray, black and white. To punish the TV for its poor programming, my father made it wear a dunce cap. Sometimes he would warn me, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re a bad boy, I&#x2019;ll turn the television on!&#x201d; Watching that television for hours was torture. But he hardly ever did it; he really didn&#x2019;t have a mean bone in his body.<br> <br>On the hutch, which she hated, my mother grew ivy, which she loved. Before long, the hutch had turned into a giant plant, furniture that lost its leaves and needed watering. It was a funny piece of furniture, a funny plant. In the dining room, there was everything you needed: a big table and lots of chairs for company, and for us, too, of course, which was the least you would expect.<br> <br>Leading to the bedrooms was the long hall where we broke speed records. The stopwatch said my father always won and Mademoiselle Superfluous lost; she wasn&#x2019;t too keen on competition, and besides, the noise of applause scared her. My room had three beds: a little one, a medium one, and a big one. I had chosen to keep my beds from when I was little, because I had good memories in them. I saw it as an embarrassment of riches even if Dad thought that my riches looked like a dump.<br> <br>On the wall there was a poster of the French pop singer Claude Fran�ois in a rhinestone-studded outfit. Dad had turned the poster into a dartboard by drawing a target on it. He said that Claude Fran�ois sang like a strangled cat, but that fortunately, the electric company had put a stop to all that.</p><h2>Neon Genesis Evangelion, Vol. 8</h2><p>Follows the adventures of Shinji Ikari, a child of the new Earth who piloted Evangelion, a colossal biomechanical weapon, to battle the fearsome Angels.</p><p></p><h2>Bowie and Big Knife Fighting System</h2><p>This valuable training guide provides insight into Jim Bowie, the &#34;Bowie knife&#34; and the fighting systems associated with both.

There is no better measure of the worldwide love of the bicycle. But of the 1.2 billion cyclists traversing the world&#x2019;s roadways and trails, few of us take the time to consider the science behind the sport. The simple process of getting about on two wheels brings us in touch with a wealth of fascinating science, and here journalist Max Glaskin investigates the scientific wonders that keep cyclists in their saddles.&nbsp;<i>Cycling Science</i> tours readers through a wide variety of topics, from tire rolling resistance and the difference between yield strength and ultimate strength, to the importance of aerodynamics and the impact that shaved legs have on speed. Each chapter explores a different subject&#x2014;fundamentals, strength and stability, materials, power, aerodynamics, and the human factor&#x2014;and is organized around a series of questions: What is the ideal frame shape? What is the biggest source of drag? What keeps a bicycle from falling over? How much power can a cyclist produce? Which muscles does cycling use? Each question is examined with the aid of explanatory diagrams and illustrations, and the book can be used to search for particular topics, or read through for a comprehensive overview of how machine and rider work together.&nbsp;Athletes have much to gain from understanding the science of their sports, and <i>Cycling Science </i>will be a must-read for cyclists of all stripes&#x2014;professionals, recreational riders, and anyone seeking to enhance their enjoyment of cycling.<br><p></p></p><p><p><b>Max Glaskin</b> is an award-winning science and technology journalist with a special interest in cycling.

The book is organized around a series of questions and answers framed to educate professional and recreational riders as well as the scientifically curious. The questions range from the practical (What is the most efficient bike design?) to the speculative (Why might plasma be the future of bike materials?). Each answer is accompanied by a terrific set of infographics.&#x201d; (<i>Boston Globe</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This book explores everything from the aerodynamics of bicycle helmets to reaction times to finding the perfect bicycle frame, drawing on studies from disciplines such as physics, brain science, and biology. Its accessible format and broad range of topics make it well suited to satisfy the curiosity of the casual recreational rider, or even the hard-core cycling enthusiast.&#x201d; (<i>Globe and Mail</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Max Glaskin&#x2019;s <i>Cycling Science </i>straddles the space between popular accounts typically found in cycling enthusiast magazines and the more academic treatments of David Gordon Wilson or Edmund Burke. It&#x2019;s a fairly large gap, but Glaskin spans it ably. Approaching its subject from the standpoints of both rider and machine, the book covers all the basics of human performance and how a two-wheeled conveyance converts that into the world&#x2019;s most efficient transportation system. Illustrations are perhaps the book&#x2019;s greatest strength: Prior to the back matter of notes, glossary and index, not a spread goes by without at least one.&#x201d; (David Schoonmaker <i>American Scientist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Usually, coffee-table books are for browsing and display.

This book has enough content to get the attention of readers&#x2014;from those interested in bicycling as a mode of transportation to those who work out on bicycles to professional racers. . . . The excellent illustrations facilitate understanding of the operation of this least polluting of all mechanical systems of transportation. In six chapters, the author covers an enormous amount of material related to the materials, design, manufacture, and physics of the bicycle. There is nothing that is missing or out of place. . . .

With her family, she pioneered throughout America&#x2019;s heartland during the 1870s and 1880s, finally settling in Dakota Territory. She married Almanzo Wilder in 1885; their only daughter, Rose, was born the following year.

But in <i>The Biology of Desire,</i> cognitive neuroscientist and former addict Marc Lewis makes a convincing case that addiction is <i>not</i> a disease, and shows why the disease model has become an obstacle to healing.<br><br>Lewis reveals addiction as an unintended consequence of the brain doing what it&#x2019;s supposed to do&#x2014;seek pleasure and relief&#x2014;in a world that&#x2019;s not cooperating. Brains are designed to restructure themselves with normal learning and development, but this process is accelerated in addiction when highly attractive rewards are pursued repeatedly. Lewis shows why treatment based on the disease model so often fails, and how treatment can be retooled to achieve lasting recovery, given the realities of brain plasticity. Combining intimate human stories with clearly rendered scientific explanation, <i>The Biology of Desire</i> is enlightening and optimistic reading for anyone who has wrestled with addiction either personally or professionally.</p><p><b>Marc Lewis, PhD, </b>is a neuroscientist and professor of developmental psychology. Now at Radboud University in the Netherlands, he taught for more than twenty years at the University of Toronto. He has authored or coauthored more than fifty journal articles in neuroscience and developmental psychology. Presently, he speaks and blogs on topics in addiction science, and his critically acclaimed book, <i>Memoirs of an Addicted Brain: A Neuroscientist Examines His Former Life on Drugs,</i> is the first to blend memoir and science in addiction studies.&nbsp; www.memoirsofanaddictedbrain.com"Wonderfully readable . . . and accessible in the descriptions of complicated brain science. . . . One finishes&nbsp;<i>The Biology of Desire</i>&nbsp;with a greater understanding of the striata and an appreciation for the argument that we may be thinking about addiction all wrong." &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> "Marc Lewis offers a unique perspective on how addiction is seen through the famously misleading distinction between nature and nurture, as though it must be one or the other, when in fact, like most aspects of human life, it is inextricably both." &#x2014;<i>National Post</i><br><br> "An insightful take on the interaction of mind and brain against the backdrop of the addict's life circumstances. . . . <i>The Biology of Desire</i>&nbsp;says a lot about the brain mechanisms underpinning addiction but, to its credit, does not stop there. With minor exceptions, we do not help addicts (and they do not help themselves) by ministering directly to their brains. As Mr. Lewis stresses throughout this unorthodox but enlightening book, people learn to be addicts, and, with effort, they can learn not to be addicts, too."&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;</i></b><i>Wall Street Journal</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> "Neuroscientist Lewis (<i>Memoirs of an Addicted Brain</i>) presents a strong argument against the disease model of addiction, which is currently predominant in medicine and popular culture alike, and bolsters it with informative and engaging narratives of addicts' lives. . . . Even when presenting more technical information, Lewis shows a keen ability to put a human face on the most groundbreaking research into addiction. Likewise, he manages to make complex findings and theories both comprehensible and interesting. . . . This book, written with hopeful sincerity, will intrigue both those who accept its thesis and those who do not." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> "Neuroscientist Lewis delves into the functioning of the addicted brain. He intends to demonstrate that addiction (substance abuse but also behavioral addictions such as eating disorders, gambling, etc.) is not a disease. . . . This objective is met by the detailed life stories of five recovering addicts the author has interviewed. Their descent into the grips of addiction reads like passages of a junkie's memoir: terrifying and page-turning. . . . This work helps make sense of how addiction operates and is recommended for readers wanting to learn more on the topic."&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;</i></b><i>Library Journal</i><br><br> "Informed by unparalleled neuroscientific insight and written with his usual flare, Marc Lewis'&nbsp;<i>The Biology of Desire</i>&nbsp;effectively refutes the medical view of addiction as a primary brain disease.

It offers far more positivity about ways out of addiction than those offered by traditional treatment approaches, providing hope for those struggling and their loved ones."&nbsp;&#x2014;Anne M.

Ex-addicts, we learn, are not 'cured,' rather they have become more connected to others, wiser, and more in touch with their own humanity. This is a hopeful message that has, as Lewis demonstrates, the advantage of also being true."&nbsp;&#x2014;Gene Heyman, author of&nbsp;<i>Addiction: A Disorder of Choice.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "A very readable, often touching, gateway into the universe of neuroscience and the shadowland of addiction." &#x2014;<i>Sydney Morning Herald </i>(Australia)<br><br> "So much nonsense is spoken about addiction and the brain. If you want to understand what's really happening, read Marc Lewis' clear, insightful and necessary book." &#x2014;Johann Hari, author of&nbsp;<i>Chasing the Scream</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> "A courageous and much needed voice in rethinking addiction&#x2014;Lewis takes addiction out of a disease model and reframes it as a negative outcome of neuroplasticity&#x2014;simply put, our brains' fundamental nature to change as a result of learning and experience. This model provides realistic hope. . . . Through his intimate personal and professional knowledge of addiction Lewis reframes our understanding of its mechanisms and nature in a way that is empowering." &#x2014;Barbara Arrowsmith-Young, bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Woman Who Changed Her Brain<br></i><br> "If you want to understand addiction&#x2014;and why it matters how the brain actually learns to become addicted&#x2014;read this book. In elegant and incisive prose, Marc Lewis expertly explains the neuroscience of desire, and how it shapes the paths of our lives." &#x2014;Maia Szalavitz, author of&nbsp;<i>Unbroken Brain</i><br><br> "Lewis has succeeded in explaining a complicated body of evidence and weaving it into an engaging narrative that will be informative and thought provoking for addiction specialists as well as lay readers." &#x2014;Matt Field, Professor of Psychological Sciences, University of Liverpool</p><h2>The Ugly American</h2><p>Reissued in new trade paperback format and design, &#34;The Ugly American&#34; is the multi-million-copy bestseller that coined the phrase for tragic American blunders abroad.</p><p>Not A Free Country, This Book Would Be Banned.<br><br>Authentic, infuriating, and explosively candid, this is the daring, classic bestseller that unmasked the blundering hypocrisy of some of our top-level diplomats.

Tender or etched in acid; hazily suggestive or chillingly definitive: a trove of strangely arresting, short master works.</strong></p> As Pankaj Mishra remarked in <em>The Nation</em>, one of the remarkable qualities of Bolano&#x2019;s short stories is that they can do the &#x201c;work of a novel.&#x201d; <em>The Return</em> contains thirteen unforgettable stories bent on returning to haunt you. Wide-ranging, suggestive, and daring, a Bolano story might concern the unexpected fate of a beautiful ex-girlfriend or a dream of meeting Enrique Lihn: his plots go anywhere and everywhere and they always surprise. Consider the title piece: a young party animal collapses in a Parisian disco and dies on the dance floor; just as his soul is departing his body, it realizes strange doings are afoot&#x2015;and what follows next defies the imagination (except Bolano&#x2019;s own).<br><br> Although a few have been serialized in <em>The New Yorker</em> and <em>Playboy</em>, most of the stories of <em>The Return</em> have never before appeared in English, and to Bolano&#x2019;s many readers will be like catnip to the cats.</p><p><p>Author of <em>2666</em> and many other acclaimed works, <strong>Roberto Bolano</strong> (1953-2003) was born in Santiago, Chile, and later lived in Mexico, Paris, and Spain. He has been acclaimed &#x201c;by far the most exciting writer to come from south of the Rio Grande in a long time&#x201d; (Ilan Stavans, <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>),&#x201d; and as &#x201c;the real thing and the rarest&#x201d; (Susan Sontag). Among his many prizes are the extremely prestigious Herralde de Novela Award and the Premio R�mulo Gallegos. He was widely considered to be the greatest Latin American writer of his generation. He wrote nine novels, two story collections, and five books of poetry, before dying in July 2003 at the age of 50.</p><p>The poet <strong>Chris Andrews</strong>&nbsp;teaches at the University of Western Sydney, Australia, where he is a member of the Writing and Society Research Centre. He has translated books by Roberto Bolano and C�sar Aira for New Directions. He has won the Anthony Hecht Poetry Prize for his poetry and the Valle-Inclan Prize for his translations.</p>Translator Chris Andrews deserves enormous recognition for introducing America to Bola�o with <i>Night in Chile</i> back in 2003. Now, with the Bola�o renaissance in full swing and the backlog of untranslated works narrowing, Andrews culls the short stories omitted from <i>Last Evenings on Earth</i>. Save perhaps the title story&#x2014;in which a dead man follows his body through an increasingly noxious series of abuses&#x2014;the stories have a subdued and sketchlike quality, from underworld confessionals like Snow and Joanna Silvestri, to tender reminiscences like Cell Mates and the heartbreaking missed romance of Clara. Devotees of Bola�o will recognize the writer's merciless (and often humorous) fusion of high art and dark human nature in small flights like Meeting with Enrique Lihn and comic bloodbaths like William Burns, though mercy plays a surprising role in several of the stories, as in the incredible Prefiguration of Lalo Cura, in which the cast and crew of high-concept pornos face their late-life requiem. The initiated and dedicated have a welcome feast of small desolations. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Folks there still whisper about Lucy Dane&#x2019;s mother, a bewitching stranger who appeared long enough to marry Carl Dane and then vanished when Lucy was just a child. Now on the brink of adulthood, Lucy experiences another loss when her friend Cheri disappears and is then found murdered, her body placed on display for all to see. Lucy&#x2019;s family has deep roots in the Ozarks, part of a community that is fiercely protective of its own. Yet despite her close ties to the land, and despite her family&#x2019;s influence, Lucy&#x2014;darkly beautiful as her mother was&#x2014;is always thought of by those around her as her mother&#x2019;s daughter. When Cheri disappears, Lucy is haunted by the two lost girls&#x2014;the mother she never knew and the friend she couldn&#x2019;t save&#x2014;and sets out with the help of a local boy, Daniel, to uncover the mystery behind Cheri&#x2019;s death.<br> &nbsp;<br> What Lucy discovers is a secret that pervades the secluded Missouri hills, and beyond that horrific revelation is a more personal one concerning what happened to her mother more than a decade earlier.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Weight of Blood</i> is an urgent look at the dark side of a bucolic landscape beyond the arm of the law, where a person can easily disappear without a trace.

I&#x2019;ve always thought outsiders are the best storytellers&#x2014;you see things other people take for granted. Which parts of your own hometown did you incorporate into the fictionalized setting of Henbane? Do you think folks back home will recognize it?</p> <p><b>LAURA MCHUGH: </b> The main thing that I took from Tecumseh was the striking landscape&#x2014;it&#x2019;s beautiful and wild and a bit ominous. I lived near the river, like Lucy, and there was a general store, now long gone, that inspired Dane&#x2019;s. Folks back home might recognize the Rockbridge Trout and Game Ranch (where Carl goes fishing), the East Wind Commune (which was down the road from my house), and The Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (a militia group whose nearby compound was raided by the FBI), all of which are mentioned in passing in the book. </p> <p><b>KS: </b> As a southerner, I put the Ozarks on the same plane as the Florida Panhandle or Georgia&#x2019;s Okeefenokee Swamp: filled with a mixture of lawless rednecks and the salt-of-the earth folks who are trying to navigate around them. I think you capture both sides very well in your story. Were you at all afraid to write about such a complicated region, or did you feel it was a natural extension of &#x201c;write what you know?&#x201d;</p> <p><b>LM: </b> I was certainly hoping not to offend my Ozark friends! It&#x2019;s fiction, of course, and my version of the Ozarks is colored by my own ideas and experiences. I was an outsider in Ozark County, but it was also my home, and I wanted to play with both sides of that experience. It&#x2019;s a fascinating place, unlike anywhere else I&#x2019;ve been. </p> <p><b>KS: </b> You&#x2019;ve said that the story was partially inspired by a brutal crime in Lebanon. Were you afraid that writing about a similar crime would cut too close to the bone?</p> <p><b>LM: </b> The real-life victim was taken to a hospital, and thankfully she survived. Cheri Stoddard, the character inspired by the case, was not so lucky, although her experience pales in comparison to what the real victim endured. I lived in Lebanon for several years, and it&#x2019;s a fairly small town where most people know each other. Though I didn&#x2019;t stick to the facts of the real case, I wanted to show that crimes like this can, and do, occur anywhere, and it&#x2019;s scary to realize how easily they can be hidden in our midst. </p> <p><b>KS: </b> Every thriller writer always gets asked what scares them. Ruth Rendell famously posited that if she told someone she was afraid of dogs, the next appearance she did, everyone would bring a dog. So, I&#x2019;ll ask what you don&#x2019;t find scary&#x2014;in books, TVs, movies. What&#x2019;s that one clich� that just makes you cringe?</p> <p><b>LM: </b> I love scary movies, but I&#x2019;m also a big scaredy-cat&#x2014;I made the kids and dog sleep in bed with me after I watched Paranormal Activity. The one thing I don&#x2019;t like in a horror film is when the bad guy wears a mask and doesn&#x2019;t speak. Michael Myers pulled it off in the original Halloween, but in general, I think it&#x2019;s much scarier when the villain has a personality and some interesting dialogue. </p> <p><b>KS: </b> We&#x2019;re so saturated in media these days that everyone wants a reference to an actor or actress for the various characters in books. This is an awful question for an author, because one reader&#x2019;s Ryan Gosling is another reader&#x2019;s David Hasselhoff.

To me, that cuts to the very nature of living in the Ozarks or any small town where you know everyone&#x2019;s history if not their intent. In your book, the truth seems to take on its own narrative angle. Can you talk a little bit about how you wove the question of trust into the story?</p> <p><b>LM: </b> Lucy is coming of age in this story, and she is starting to question things that she had always accepted. Trust is a big part of that. She&#x2019;s learning how to follow her own instincts and figure out for herself where her loyalties lie.

And what a wealth of lessons&nbsp;there&nbsp;are to be learned in these pages' (David McCullough)Based on thousands of pages from Leonardo's astonishing notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work, Walter Isaacson weaves a narrative that connects his art to his science. He shows how Leonardo's genius was based on skills we can improve in ourselves, such as passionate curiosity, careful observation, and an imagination so playful that it flirted with fantasy.<br><br>He produced the two most famous paintings in history, The Last Supperand the Mona Lisa. But in his own mind, he was just as much a man of science and technology. With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences, made iconic by his drawing of Vitruvian Man, made him history's most creative genius.<br><br>His creativity, like that of other great innovators, came from having wide-ranging passions. He peeled flesh off the faces of cadavers, drew the muscles that move the lips, and then painted history's most memorable smile. He explored the math of optics, showed how light rays strike the cornea, and produced illusions of changing perspectives in The Last Supper. Isaacson also describes how Leonardo's lifelong enthusiasm for staging theatrical productions informed his paintings and inventions.<br><br>Leonardo's delight at combining diverse passions remains the ultimate recipe for creativity. So, too, does his ease at being a bit of a misfit: illegitimate, gay, vegetarian, left-handed, easily distracted, and at times heretical. His life should remind us of the importance of instilling, both in ourselves and our children, not just received knowledge but a willingness to question it-to be imaginative and, like talented misfits and rebels in any era, to think different.</p><h2>Dorrie and the Halloween Plot</h2><p>A disguised Dorrie just happens to be in the right place at the right time when the Halloween Demons attempt to kidnap the Great Sorceress and steal the irreplaceable Book of Shadows</p><p>Patricia Coombs Born July 23, 1926, Los Angeles, CA.

The author suggests that everyone has the power to change the way they perceive themselves and others, and revolutionize the way they work, communicate and love, by investigating the learning triggers derived from six basic learning patterns. These patterns are all based on how we assimilate auditory, visual, and kinaesthetic information.</p><p>Why do some of us master languages easily while others give up in frustration? Why are some of us perfectly organized and others scatter papers everywhere? Why do some people prefer written communication while others would rather talk? In The Open Mind, you will discover that the answers to these and many other &#34;personality&#34; riddles lie in the particular way your mind works. Understanding your unique pattern and the ones of the people you know will revolutionize the way you communicate, work, and love. Dr. Markova teaches that each of us uses one of six learning patterns, all based on the way we process auditory, visual, and kinesthetic information. If your conscious mind is most stimulated by movement, for instance, it will be hard for you to learn while sitting still. If, on the other hand, movement stimulates your unconscious mind, you may find competitive sports frustrating. In The Open Mind, Dr. Markova guides you through detailed descriptions of each thinking pattern and teaches how to recognize them in yourself and others.<b> Dawna Markova Ph.D. is internationally known for her ground-breaking work in helping people learn with passion and live purposefully.

His trademark use of electrifying color combinations, and mixing antiques, modern furniture, and abstract paintings became the "in style" for the chic of the day, including Vidal Sassoon and Helena Rubinstein. By the &#x2019;70s, David Hicks was a brand; his company was making wallpaper, fabrics, and linens and had outposts in eight countries, including the U.S. where he worked with the young Mark Hampton, and where his wallpaper was used in the White House.

A keen observer of the reality around her as well as within, Teresa in these letters focuses light on many of the struggles in both the Carmelite order and the church of sixteenth-century Spain. She introduces us to major personalities who have left their mark on history.<br><br>Through her letters historians gain a better knowledge of the chronology of events in Teresa's life and how she related to the diverse people she had dealings with. A number of everyday particulars that compilers and editors of those times considered unimportant are today prized. Her worries, her troubles and triumphs, her expressions of sadness and joy, are all present here. With a compelling spontaneity, these letters disclose a Teresa in a complex variety of circumstances. The extraordinary gifts of grace bestowed by God on this Spanish Madre fortified her for a demanding ministry of service which entailed heavy responsibilities and that drew her contemplative soul into a whirl of activities. Because of the limited means of travel and communication in the sixteenth century, the organization of a reform like hers, with its unavoidable business matters, had to be dealt with chiefly through correspondence, a chafing duty that became one of Teresa's greatest trials. She often repeated that letter-writing was her biggest burden, a wearisome task that cost her more than all the miserable roads and bad weather experienced on her journeys through Spain. <br><br>With its endnotes, biographical sketches, and above all, fresh translation, this second volume of Teresa's Collected Letters opens again another door into the fascinating world of this saint, one of the greatest women history has known.</p><p></p><h2>East of the Sun &amp; West of the Moon</h2><p>A young maiden searches for the noble youth whom she loves but who must marry the evil troll princess</p><p>A richly illustrated version of a classic fairy tale.

He lives outside Boulder, Colorado.<p>1Florida is a warm magnet for Canadians. They flock to the sunshine by the tens of thousands, filling hotels, thronging to restaurants, pumping millions of dollars into local economies from Jacksonville to Miami to Tampa. They are known as Snowbirds because their southerly migratory patterns swell in numbers when winter temperatures plunge in the Great White North.<br>The influx lies at the soul of a love-hate relationship with Florida residents, who want the Canadian tourists&#x2019; economic benefits but would just as soon do without their slow-paced lifestyle.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the goddamn Canadians, Bob,&#x201d; moaned one caller to a talk show.<br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s new?&#x201d; responded the host.<br>&#x201c;Got behind nineteen of them in traffic, Bob.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All of them were in Hyundais, Bob. Never got out of third gear.&#x201d;<br>The Snowbirds are also derided as being so tight with a dollar that a standard joke among waiters is that the main difference between Canadians and canoes is that canoes sometimes will tip. It is also jokingly said that ten thousand Canadian visitors can boost the local economy by a total of $450.<br>But that is all said with more than a bit of tongue in cheek, for without the Snowbirds the Florida economy would suffer instant, great losses. Therefore, they are welcomed with open arms and cash registers, and everything possible is done to make their stays enjoyable, including attention by the police in various municipalities. For if something bad happens to a Canadian tourist, word quickly filters back to Toronto or Montreal, affecting decisions on vacation destinations. On Mother&#x2019;s Day in 1989, something very bad indeed happened to one Canadian tourist and the result would hang like a worrisome dark cloud over the Tampa-St. Petersburg area for five long years before it was finally resolved.<br>Gayle Arquette, a chestnut-haired, strikingly beautiful girl from Ontario, was on vacation, taking a welcome break after graduating from college and before assuming a new job as a social worker. Accompanied by her friend, Linda Lyle, also a vibrant, good-looking young woman in her early twenties, Gayle fled Canada on holiday, lured by the spring sunshine and the mythical draw of Florida as a fun and exciting place for the young. Daytona Beach, made famous by the movie and song Where the Boys Are, is located on the Atlantic Ocean side of the state, but Gayle and Linda had no doubt that a pair of pretty girls could find a social life on Florida&#x2019;s west coast.<br>If one views Florida as shaped like the open palm of the right hand, then the thumb hanging slightly apart from the mainland, separated by the vastness of Tampa Bay, is Pinellas County. The urban metropolis of Tampa is on the eastern side of the bay, and St. Petersburg is at the lower western side. Along the coast, stretching north from St. Petersburg, is a long, thin line of beach communities flanked by water on both sides and linked to inland Pinellas County by a series of bridges.<br>About halfway up the peninsula are the quaintly named beachfront towns of Treasure Island and Madeira Beach, and it was in a &#x201c;Mad Beach&#x201d; condominium that Gayle and Linda settled for their Florida stay. The water came almost to their front door, as the Gulf of Mexico stretched open and wide toward the setting sun. Shopping was plentiful, particularly among the quaint shops of the Boardwalk, a collection of specialty shops, restaurants, and boat businesses clustered along weathered piers that hang out over the water along 128th Avenue, facing the watery cut between Mad Beach and Treasure Island known as John&#x2019;s Pass. And cute guys seemed plentiful, whether riding colorful jet skis, loafing about the beach-side bars, or soaking up tans on the beach.<br>In fact, Gayle and Linda agreed to go fishing with two young men they had met on one of their strolls along the Boardwalk. First, however, Gayle needed to complete a special task. She spent much of Sunday, May 14, 1989, preparing Mother&#x2019;s Day dinner for her mother, aunt, uncle, and Linda. The weather was pleasant and they joked about the difference in temperature between May in Ontario and May along the Florida Suncoast.<br>When the meal was done and the dishes cleaned, the girls waved goodbye to the adults and headed out for their evening, walking over to their first stop, a 7-Eleven convenience store on Gulf Boulevard, the town&#x2019;s main street, to pick up a six-pack of beer about 9:30 P.M.<br>In the parking lot of the store sat a large, dark-colored trucklike vehicle that Gayle would recall as something like a Jeep Cherokee, Isuzu Trooper, or Ford Bronco&#x2014;one of those four-wheel-drive, all-terrain jobs. It wore Florida plates.<br>The driver struck up a laughing conversation with the girls, whom he had guessed were visitors, and soon determined they were from Canada. He was a big guy in his mid-thirties, standing about five feet, nine inches tall and weighing about two-hundred pounds. He was well tanned and had reddish blond hair cut short and a pale mustache of the same color. He quickly extended his hand and introduced himself as Dave Posner, saying he knew a lot about Canada because he once had lived in upper New York State. The voice was light and personable, the manner polite.<br>There was a note of seriousness, almost concern, in his voice as he asked them why they were out alone in this area. This particular stretch was considered a high-crime locale, he warned, and they should be very wary about talking to any strangers, including himself. When told they were on their way to meet a couple of guys at Fisherman&#x2019;s Wharf, Dave offered them a ride in his truck.<br>The ride up Gulf Boulevard was brief, but the time seemed to pass even faster because of Dave&#x2019;s steady chatter about the water and the excitement of living in coastal Florida. Arriving at the restaurant, he made a courteous offer, accompanied by a bright smile. Linda got out of the vehicle and walked away, but as Gayle was exiting, she mentioned that she was interested in doing some fishing. Dave replied that he had a 30-foot boat and would be happy to take them out tomorrow for a cruise around the area and to let them try their luck for a deepwater catch.<br>Gayle quickly accepted for both of them, certain that Linda would want to come along. Dave said that was terrific, and he would meet them tomorrow about 2 P.M., because it took about two hours to get from his house, across Tampa Bay, around the tip of Pinellas County and up to John&#x2019;s Pass. He pointed in the darkness toward the Boardwalk and a pier at the very end. Be at Don&#x2019;s Dock at two, he said.<br>Gayle was excited about the prospect of a ride out on the open water, but Linda was just as adamant that she would not be coming along. There was something about that Posner guy she didn&#x2019;t like, and Gayle should not meet him either, she warned. Nonsense, argued Gayle, he&#x2019;s just a nice guy, and anyway, he&#x2019;s so old, probably almost in his forties. Come on, Linda, she pleaded, come along. Absolutely not, Linda replied, and that was that.<br>Linda stuck to her decision the next day after lunch and Gayle finally walked to the Boardwalk by herself. She did not see the dark truck parked anywhere, but made her way along the line of shops, examining T-shirts and gifts, looking at the nautical decor of the stores, such as the model shark tangled in a net over a doorway. Large boats were tied up awaiting their scheduled departure with a load of tourists, and people were buying bait. A clutch of sleepy pelicans lay asleep at the edge of the water, their long bills tucked beneath their wings, looking like large balls of feathers.<br>Shielding her eyes against the bright sun, she finally caught sight of Dave riding near the boat dock, alone in a boat that was faded blue on the outside and white inside. It seemed to her to be an older model, all boxy angles, more of a fishing boat than one of the sleek fiberglass powerboats that sliced through the water in front of some big outboard engine. She also noticed that the boat wasn&#x2019;t thirty feet long as he had boasted, but a stubby seventeen-to-twenty footer. He saw her about the same time and spun the wheel, bringing the boat to bump against the fenders of the pier, and Gayle stepped quickly aboard. Dave wanted to know where Linda was, and a somewhat embarrassed Gayle explained that her friend had decided not to come for the ride. She thought she saw a flash of disappointment in his eyes, but he gave her only a bright smile as she settled into one of the two pedestal seats at the front of the boat. With a slight push of the throttle, the boat&#x2019;s inboard-outboard engine rumbled louder and they moved beneath the John&#x2019;s Pass bridge, heading for the Gulf.<br>But as soon as they cleared the protection of the land, the pointed bow of the boat began to slap hard into the waves as rough weather somewhere far away churned the normally placid Gulf waters. So instead of pushing into deep water, Dave turned the boat and gave Gayle a tour of the sandy white Pinellas County beaches.<br>For more than six hours, they talked as he pointed out things of interest beyond the sandy ribbon of shoreline. He had made three sandwiches, because he had expected Linda to accompany them, and they shared the odd one. There was no beer or any alcohol aboard, but he did have a thermos filled with icy water. The AM-FM radio in front of her did not work, but otherwise Gayle felt totally safe and at peace as she spun around in the swivel seat, sinking comfortably into the worn upholstery as the sun toasted her. When she faced the stern of the boat, there was a completely open area before the engine cover and a pair of flanking squarish, boxlike things stretched from side to side across the back. A dark blue canvas canopy was laid back and lashed down around the stern. Once, looking curiously at the engine, she saw it was painted yellow and the word Volvo was stamped across the top. Dave baited her hook and helped teach her how to fish in deep water...</p></p><h2>Retribution (Dark-Hunter, Bk 20)</h2><p><p><b><i>From #1 </i>New York Times <i>bestselling author Sherrilyn Kenyon comes the next thrilling installment in her blockbuster Dark-Hunter� series </i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br><b><i></i></b>Harm no human... </p><p>A hired gunslinger, William Jessup Brady lived his life with one foot in the grave.

In its path: the charming old city of Savannah, where the Lester ladies-attractive widow Sara and her feisty twelve-year-old daughter Hattie-struggle to save the family rice plantation.

Descended from a soldier of the Virginia Continental Line who fought in the American Revolution, Jakes is one of today&#x2019;s most distinguished authors of historical fiction.The Christmas of 1864 wasn't a merry one in Savannah, as the Union forces took control of the Confederate city. Tensions simmered between the Union forces and the defiant Southerners. Against this backdrop, widowed Sara Lester and her 12-year-old daughter, Hattie, take refuge in a friend's Savannah home, only to have a rough encounter with rogue Union foragers. The incident angers young Hattie and offends the Union occupiers, leading the girl to a confrontation with William Tecumseh Sherman. Dylan Baker, who knows his way around a Southern accent, puts a bit of exaggeration in his accents and characterizations to highlight the human comedy in this wartime conflict. His approach helps reveal the central characters in both the harsh light of a tense situation and, later, in the softer, warmer glow befitting a holiday season.

With his characteristic candor and piercing insight, author Richard Carlson demonstrates how to resolve such common domestic tensions as:<br><ul><li>Children who are whining or fighting</li><li>Issues with your spouse</li><li>Hassles over household chores</li><li>Difficult teenagers<br></li></ul></p><p>"While it's easy to allow little things to take over our lives, there are things we can do to make life around the house less stressful," writes Richard Carlson in <i>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff with Your Family: Simple Ways to Keep Daily Responsibilities and Household Chores from Taking Over Your Life</i>. In this collection of 98 brief essays, Carlson (author of <i>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff ... And It's All Small Stuff</i>) meditates on small, but meaningful ways to avoid being overwhelmed by life, particularly family life. From Number 8: Make Peace with Bickering, to Number 14: Encourage Boredom in Your Children, to Number 72: Stop Exaggerating Your Workload, Carlson's messages serve as reminders for truisms most readers already know but have lost sight of in the bustle of daily life. Carlson's "ways" may be simple, but simplicity is not stupid--his book offers vital injections of wisdom. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i>Best-selling author Richard Carlson, Ph.D., creator of the popular Don&#39;t Sweat the Small Stuff series and the just published Don&#39;t Get Scrooged, died suddenly of cardiac arrest enroute to New York on December 13. Carlson, 45, published his first book in 1985 and went on to publish more than 20 books that remain popular in English and in translation in 130 languages and 35 countries. Richard Carlson grew up in Piedmont, CA. He received his undergraduate degree from Pepperdine University and his Ph.D. in psychology from Sierra University. He was in private practice as a psychotherapist when he started to publish books about psychological and spiritual health. As his books started to attract a large audience, he began writing full time so he could teach more people how to live with presence and ease by cultivating gratitude and generosity. Dr. Carlson was a large supporter of and participant in the National Center for Family Literacy and at the time of his death he was working on a project with them called for &#34;A Penny a Book&#34; from publishers, authors and literary agents to promote literacy.

An essential key to the understanding of its enigmatic character is the realization that it comes within the category of apocalyptic literature, in which acknowledged symbols were used to disguise the real meaning. According to the author, that which &#34;to the uninitiated modern reader appears grotesque imagery spoke with power to John&#39;s fellow-Christians . . &#34; Due weight is also given to the Christology of the book, which the author sees as inseparable from its eschatology.</p><p></p><h2>Fire in the Night: 20 Years Since the Piper Alpha Disaster</h2><p>The fire was visible 70 miles away as a distant flame on the horizon.

At the center stood the Piper Alpha oil platform, once the world's single largest oil producer. On July 6, 1988, its final day, it was ablaze with 226 men on board. Only 61 would survive.

Challenging the way in which we rationalise punishment and coercion as being for the child&#39;s &#39;own good&#39;, she illuminates the cost in compassion and humanity in later life, both in the private and public domain. Her message is clear: &#39;people whose integrity has not been damaged in childhood; will feel no need to harm another person or themselves.&#39;</p><p>Miller explores the backgrounds of extreme cases of self-destructive and violent individuals to further her theories on longterm consequences of abusive childrearing. Her conclusions about what creates a drug addict, a murderer, even a Hitler, stray far from psychoanalytic dogma about human nature. Miller paints a jolting picture of the violent world each generation helps shape when traditional upbringing, with its hidden cruelty, is perpetuated. She also offers a way out by striving to resensitize the child in the adult, to unlock an emotional life frozen in repression.Other books by <b>Alice Miller</b>, the internationally renowned psychoanalyst, include <i>The Drama of the Gifted Child: The Search for the True Self</i>, <i>The Body Never Lies: The Lingering Effects of Cruel Parenting</i>, <i>The Truth Will Set You Free: Overcoming Emotional Blindness and Finding Your True Adult Self</i>, <i>Banished Knowledge: Facing Childhood Injuries</i>, <i>Breaking Down the Wall of Silence: The Liberating Experience of Facing Painful Truth</i>, and <i>The Untouched Key: Tracing Childhood Trauma in Creativity and Destructiveness</i>.

The United States had to fight a war across two oceans and three continents-and to do so it had to build and equip a military that was all but nonexistent before the war began. Never in the nation's history did it have to create, outfit, transport, and supply huge armies, navies, and air forces on so many distant and disparate fronts.<br>The Axis powers might have fielded better trained soldiers, better weapons, better tanks and aircraft. But they could not match American productivity. America buried its enemies in aircraft, ships, tanks, and guns; in this sense, American industry, and American workers, won World War II. The scale of effort was titanic, and the result historic. Not only did it determine the outcome of the war, but it transformed the American economy and society. Maury Klein's <i>A Call to Arms</i> is the definitive narrative history of this epic struggle, told by one of America's greatest historians of business and economics, and renders the transformation of America with a depth and vividness never available before.</p></p><p>Maury Klein is renowned as one of the finest historians of American business and economy. He is the author of many books, including <i>The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America</i>; and <i>Rainbow's End: The Crash of 1929</i>. He is Professor Emeritus of History at the University of Rhode Island. He lives in Saunderstown, Rhode Island.<p>&#x201c;'We must be the great arsenal of democracy,' declared Franklin Roosevelt in December 1940. In the five wartime years that followed, his countrymen stocked that arsenal with astounding quantities of the instruments of war &#x2013; even while expanding the civilian sector of the economy as well. For all the valor of its warriors on land, sea, and air, in the last analysis it was the stupefying productivity of America's behemoth economy that constituted the nation's greatest contribution to victory. Maury Klein tells the story of the World War II "production miracle" in all its complexity, contention, and drama. Meticulously researched, incisively argued, and fetchingly written, A Call to Arms is the authoritative account of one of America's most prodigious achievements.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David M. Kennedy, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of FREEDOM FROM FEAR: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945</i></p><p>&#x201c;For those who believe the "grand narrative" has disappeared, I strongly recommend Maury Klein's elegant and endlessly fascinating account of America's mobilization for World War II. Combining a deft understanding of the enormous forces that won the war and changed the world's direction along with a jeweler's eye for the anecdotes that bring history alive, Klein has produced the best one-volume account to date. The shrewd analysis superb writing, and masterful storytelling sweep the reader along. History doesn't get much better than this.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David M. Oshinsky, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of POLIO: An American Story and A CONSPIRACY SO IMMENSE: The World of Joe McCarthy</i></p><p>&#x201c;While the United States did indeed become the arsenal of democracy in World War II, it was far from a smooth or inevitable process. In this outstanding achievement of research, synthesis, and lucid writing, Maury Klein traces the fits and starts, bureaucratic infighting, and eventual unparalleled success of America's economic mobilization that outproduced all enemies combined and enabled the allies to win the war.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>James M. McPherson, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Battle Cry of Freedom and Tried By War: Abraham Lincoln as Commander-in-Chief</i></p><p>&#x201c;Everyone knows that America's economic mobilization was the great force that won World War II--but there was so much more to it than that. In A Call to Arms, one of our greatest historians vividly captures the titanic struggle to turn a Depression-wracked country into a superpower. We see engineers accomplishing the seemingly impossible, managers cracking open production bottlenecks, the troubles and triumphs of weapon design and deployment, and squabbling politicians, businessmen, and labor leaders, all driven forward by the complicated man in the White House, President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Where others have seen only numbers, Maury Klein finds a story--a hell of a story.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>T. J. Stiles, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt</i></p><p>&#x201c;The story of how America became the &#x2018;great arsenal of democracy' is the subject of A CALL TO ARMS, and I can't imagine it being told more thoroughly, authoritatively or definitively. Maury Klein crowns his long career with this massive examination of one of the most important aspects of 20th-century American history and one of the least documented or understood. In every respect, "A Call to Arms" is a remarkable and singularly important piece of work.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Washington Post,one of Jonathan Yardley's favorite books of 2013</i></p><p>&#x201c;[A] magisterial account. Exhaustively researched and engagingly written, this marvelous book tells an epic story. It paints on a broad canvas, yet simultaneously limns detailed and fascinating miniatures of compelling people and places. It deserves a spot on the bookshelf alongside David Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning "Freedom From Fear" as the definitive rendering of the World War II home front.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Maury Klein, the noted economic historian, has written a sweeping account of how America got ready for war. A CALL TO ARMS is history writ both large and small--from FDR at cocktail hour to ordinary workers on the assembly line, from portraits of cabinet chiefs to detailed discussions of industrial fabrication and the endless turf battles of New Deal agencies.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;Except for a couple of nearly unreadable official histories, there is no comprehensive retelling of the &#x2018;production Miracle' that made the United States the "Arsenal of Democracy.' Maury Klein's A CALL TO ARMS fills that gap. Moreover, it does so in a spectacular fashion. Klein's work does the same for the story of American production that Adam Tooze (Wages of Destruction, 2006) did for those trying to grasp the scope of Germany's World War II economic effort...for those seeking a comprehensive understanding of World War II, A CALL TO ARMS is a must read. Moreover, considering the subject matter, this is a great read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Military History Quarterly</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Klein's] coverage of the organization of American institutional, economic, military, and governmental might for WWII is both sobering and inspiring....reminiscent of Arthur Schlesinger's earlier, sweeping volumes on the early New Deal--uncommonly perceptive, enjoyably readable, and authoritative.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Thoroughly researched, objective and authoritative in tone, this is likely to be the definitive work on this topic for years to come.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;Very well written and exhaustively researched, this masterpiece demonstrates that accomplished scholarly work can also be accessible. Highly recommended to both academics and lay readers.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal (starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Klein is a writer, historian and, most enjoyably, a storyteller...The excellent, broader story [he] tells in <i>A Call to Arms</i> is about a country that fought with itself before it could fight its enemies abroad.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dallas Morning News</i></p></p><h2>Le Morte Darthur</h2><p>The greatest English version of the stories of King Arthur, <em>Le Morte D'Arthur</em> was completed in 1469-70 by Sir Thomas Malory, "knight prisoner." This edition is the first designed for the general reader to be based on the "Winchester manuscript" which represents what Malory wrote more closely than the version printed by William Caxton. Extensively annotated, this edition is highly user-friendly.</p><p>There has been humour, heartbreak, and breathtaking visions, and the continuous excitement of trying to capture the beauty of Malory&#39;s scenes in watercolour. In the quietest moments, I liked to imagine ghosts roosting in my studio - from distant figures who may have existed and inspired the legend, to the storytellers, artists, and their creations that have served it. There are rewards in such good company and I feel most privileged to have contributed to a tradition so close to my heart, and served a world of such beauty.....beauty with a serrated edge. Anna Marie FergusonThe legends of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table have inspired some of the greatest works of literature--from Cervantes's Don Quixote to Tennyson's Idylls of the King. Although many versions exist, Malory's stands as the classic rendition. Malory wrote the book while in Newgate Prison during the last three years of his life; it was published some fourteen years later, in 1485, by William Caxton. The tales, steeped in the magic of Merlin, the powerful cords of the chivalric code, and the age-old dramas of love and death, resound across the centuries. <br>The stories of King Arthur, Lancelot, Queen Guenever, and Tristram and Isolde seem astonishingly moving and modern. Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur endures and inspires because it embodies mankind's deepest yearnings for brotherhood and community, a love worth dying for, and valor, honor, and chivalry.</p><h2>The ARRL Antenna Compendium (Radio Amateur&#39;s Library, Publication No. 112, etc.)</h2><p>-- Covers a wide range of antenna types and related topics, including innovative verticals, an attic tri-bander, antenna modeling and propagation.</p><p></p><h2>Karate Dojo</h2><p>KARATE is not only a means of self-defense; it is also a sport and a philosophy.

Now David Dungan re-examines the primary source for this history, the Ecclesiastical History of the fourth-century Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea, in the light of Hellenistic political thought. He reaches startling new conclusions: that we usually use the term &#34;canon&#34; incorrectly; that the legal imposition of a &#34;canon&#34; or &#34;rule&#34; upon scripture was a fourth- and fifth-century phenomenon enforced with the power of the Roman imperial government; that the forces shaping the New Testament canon are much earlier than the second-century crisis occasioned by Marcion, and that they are political forces. Dungan discusses how the scripture selection process worked, book-by-book, as he examines the criteria used-and not used-to make these decisions. Finally he describes the consequences of the emperor Constantine&#39;s tremendous achievement in transforming orthodox, Catholic Christianity into imperial Christianity.</p><p>David Dungan is Professor of Religion at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville and author, with David R. Cartlidge, of Documents of the Study of the Gospels, rev. and enlarged edition (1994, 0-8006-2809-8).Beginning with a meticulous study of just what a canon is, Dungan offers a panoramic view of the first three centuries of Christian history and how the major players, both ecclesiastical and civil, contributed to defining the collection of writings we call the New Testament. One of the claims of the bestselling novel <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> is that the institution of theCatholic Church suppressed some writings that challenged its own views and agendas. Dungan, professor of religion at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, finds this view untenable and offers as evidence a long and detailed examination of the scripture selection process as documented by the fourth-century church historian Eusebius. While various schools of Christianity exerted pressure to either include or exclude certain works, he concludes that the selection process produced "a minimalist canon, but one that is as hard as rock: all regional agendas have been intentionally ignored, all personal proclivities of prominent theologians or bishops dispensed with, every possible taint of 'politicking' avoided." Although written for the general reader, the book's detail can be overwhelming. But while his case for an orthodox canon is not unassailable, he succeeds in providing a wealth of information to enable readers to decide for themselves. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When a crime spree in a well-to-do neighborhood not far from Sir John's home turns from robbery to murder, and witnesses identify the perpetrators as black men, the focus shifts from police work to prejudice. When the criminals are ultimately revealed to be white men in blackface, Jeremy and Sir John must look deeper into the hearts and minds of their neighbors to discover the real motive for the attacks and cast off their own biases before solving the crime. Alexander draws an accurate picture of racial hypocrisy in an era when slavery, though banned in England, was permitted in its colonies.

Michael Straczynski</b></p> <p><strong>Q. Were you surprised by the tremendous success of SUPERMAN: EARTH ONE Vol. 1?</strong></p> <p>A. J. Michael Straczynski: Yes and no. Any time one writes a book of any sort, one hopes for success with it. I knew that the story was as solid as I could make it, the art was great, and our lead character is one of the most recognizable figures in the world, so all of the elements were there. The question then becomes the degree to which it resonates with an audience: do they care about the story and the characters?</p> <p>So while I suspected the book would do well, given the elements above, I never expected that it would spend 37 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list for graphic novels. What's especially interesting about that is that in the weeks and months since it came out, I heard from a massive number of readers who said that they'd never picked up a Superman comic before, that the character hadn't really interested them previously, but that they bought, and enjoyed, this one. I think we managed to reach a considerable number of folks who had never been able to dial into the character before.</p> <p>We'd taken a rather risky path with the character of Clark Kent in the book, so to receive both a very strong response in both critical reception and sales was a huge validation that we'd made the right choice.</p> <p><strong>Q. Many creators have re-imagined Superman's origin story throughout the years. What frame of mind did you put yourself in to create a new, unique vision that stands by itself?</strong></p> <p>A. J. Michael Straczynski: The answer to that dovetails rather neatly into the comments above, but requires a bit of a long story. For two years I'd worked in Vancouver as writer/producer on a Showtime TV series called Jeremiah. Every week, I'd go down to the comics store on Granville near Robson for my comics fix. Now, if you know that area, then you know that Granville is a haven for street kids: the lost and the transitional, the runaways and the throwaways. I would often see them walk into the comics store in search of something, anything that resonated with them, and the world in which they had to live. They would scan the multicolored racks with desperate eyes, looking for something uplifting that would speak to them...and return to the streets empty handed. </p> <p>For Superman to remain relevant, the character must grow and change and evolve, must be re-invented for each new generation. So that's what I decided to do with Superman: bring him to Metropolis in his early 20s today, right now, and give him the same task that awaits so many others at that age: let him define himself, figure out what he wants to do with his life and show the difficulties, but also the joys, of making that happen.</p> <p><strong>Q. What is the core tenet behind the SUPERMAN: EARTH ONE mythology you and artist Shane Davis have created?</strong></p> <p>A. J. Michael Straczynski: To show the human side of Clark and make him relatable. The key thing about Superman is that while you cannot pierce his skin, you can pierce his heart. His journey has to be one filled with action but it must also be a very personal journey of discovery. We must all discover who we are, and what we stand for when standing is the most difficult. Clark Kent is no different in that respect, and that key gave us our central approach to the character.</p> <p><strong>Q. Parasite is the starring villain in Vol. 2. What aspects of the character have you focused on? </strong></p> <p>A. J. Michael Straczynski: The Parasite is in a way the mirror image of Superman, in that Superman gives of himself to help others, and the Parasite takes from others to strengthen himself. So that gave us our focus from a thematic perspective. Before the accident that transforms him, he is a serial killer who exploits people until he no longer needs them, then murders them and moves on. Cold, calculating, conscienceless and very much in control. As Parasite, when the hunger for power hits him, he is very much out of control, and that dichotomy gave us some really cool dynamics to play with.</p> <p><strong>Q. Your version of Clark Kent isn't the instantly heroic Boy Scout archetype we all know. Will we see further change in Clark in Vol. 2? </strong></p> <p>A. J. Michael Straczynski: For me, the fun in writing Clark is that he's not so much a boy scout as he is, in his way, kind of naive when he comes to Metropolis for the first time. He's led a life in which he was always afraid that he might accidentally hurt someone, or that his powers might be discovered, so he withdrew into himself, leading a life where he touched as few people as possible, and was touched by few of them in return. Because he was an outsider, in a very literal sense, there was always a barrier between him and other people, between him and fun. But now that he's out in the world, on his own for the first time, he has to relate to other people more intimately than he has in the past, and there's a certain amount of fun involved in that, some of it at his expense. He has to figure out how to rent an apartment on his own, and how to deal with the beautiful young woman next door who thinks he's really cute. He's protective, and strong, but also very shy in his ways, and that ends up being very attractive.</p> <p><strong>Q. Are there any other supporting characters from the Superman mythos we'll see in Vol. 2?</strong></p> <p>A. J. Michael Straczynski: In addition to Parasite, there's an appearance by one character known well to fans of Superman, but whom I've been deliberately holding back until I could bring him in via a new path, reinventing him in ways that parallel what we're doing with Clark. I think this will be a pleasant surprise for readers, especially given the character he arrives alongside. I don't think anybody will see this one coming.</p><b>J.

In the twenty years since, she has written 89 more novels and become the third largest selling female author in the world, with 300 million copies of her books sold in 19 languages in 98 countries. Her most recent bestsellers, <em>Masquerade,</em> <em>Rivals,</em> and <em>Heiress,</em> have all sold more than one million copies each. She is known for her strong, decisive characters, her extraordinary ability to re-create a time and place, and her unerring courage to confront important, controversial issues, like alcoholism and sexual abuse, in her stories.<p>All of her novels are meticulously researched, an endeavor she shares with her husband, Bill Dailey. The couple met in 1963, when Janet worked as a secretary for the construction company Bill owned. The two travel extensively to scout story locations, and have visited all 50 states; these days, they are likely to fly, but miss the time when they drove cross country, a trailer attached to their car. Janet Dailey also reads voraciously about every aspect of any subject she writes about; as she remarks, "Accuracy is important in genre fiction; you have to get it right, zero in on the real details. That's the way to make writing come alive and not irritate the readers with carelessness."</p><p>When they are not traveling, the couple spend time at their home on the shore of Lake Taneycomo in Branson, Missouri. It is the part of the country Dailey loves best, partly because, she says, "The people around me are more interested in their problems and their lives, and that sort of keeps me in touch with reality. They think it's nice that I write, but they really couldn't care less."</p><p>Allison Janney has been featured on Broadway (<em>Present Laughter),</em> in films (<em>Big Night</em> and <em>First Wives Club)</em> and on television shows on all four networks.</p></p><h2>The Language of the Night: Essays on Fantasy and Science Fiction</h2><p>A Nebula and Hugo Award-winning writer of science fiction presents a collection of essays that explores the various issues, concepts, challenges, and paradoxes that confront the science fiction writer.</p><p>Originally published in 1979 ( LJ 5/1/79), revised in 1989 for British publication, and finally republished here in the revised edition, this work by one of fantasy and sf's greats is a welcome treat for anyone who loves words and stories. Le Guin ( Searoad: The Chronicles of Klatsand , HarperCollins, 1991) is as expert in creating mellifluous and enchanting essays as she is in creating the luscious and complex worlds of her fiction. Stylistically, she manages a balance between quasi-academic seriousness and conversational humor (a balance that original editor Susan Wood does not attain in her introductions). Despite being three to 13 years out of date, depending on the extent of revision, her comments on the state of the genre, the process of writing, and the influence of gender on literature are as fresh as ever. The book is dated only in its ratio of female to male writers of fantasy and sf, which is now closer than it was when Le Guin first wrote. Highly recommended for all literature and women's studies collections.<br><i>- Keith R.A. DeCan dido, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.For Le Guin, writing science fiction or fantasy is an intuitive, self-exploratory act, an inner-space voyage in which she unearths dreams and archetypes that connect her with the outer world. In these conversational, feisty essays, an energizing mind trip for SF fans, she dissects her own fiction, discusses technique and explores the potential of SF and fantasy, which she considers different branches of the same form of writing. Most SF has been regressive and unimaginative, she argues, by portraying authoritarian dystopias instead of democratic socialist societies. She also berates the genre for its marginalization of women, both as fictional characters and as writers. This is essentially a reissue of a 1979 compilation that went out of print in 1982. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Genealogy of Greek Mythology: An Illustrated Family Tree of Greek Myth from the First Gods to the Founders of Rome</h2><p><p>A stunning, fully illustrated and comprehensively annotated genealogical map of the universe of Greek myth, presented in a unique, easy-to-use format. From the television hit <b>Xena</b>, to the Oscar-winning box-office smash <b>Gladiator</b> and to Broadway's Medea, the sagas of antiquity continue to attract avid audiences. Now the lore and legend of Ancient Greece have been distilled into one spectacularly illustrated resource. The Genealogy of Greek Mythology brings to life the complete cast of characters, mortal and mythic alike. Accompanied by more than 125 captivating full-color photographs of art and artifacts, the narratives and bloodlines mapped out in The Genealogy of Greek Mythology are wonderfully user friendly. Beginning with Chaos-the period before the Earth was born-Vanessa James traces the succession of gods and titans through to the first generations of historically verifiable people of the ancient Aegean. Packed with over 3,000 entries, this incredibly detailed resource also features a star chart, regional map, and who's who guide to the Olympian gods. Each side of the book's unique accordion-paged design can be perused section-by-section or fanned out to reveal the entire genealogy in more than seventeen elegant feet.<br> </p></p><p><p>Vanessa James, Ph.D., is an associate professor of theater at Mount Holyoke College, and has served as an art director for film, television, and stage productions, as well as shows at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The book/chart begins with the earliest surviving account of the creation of the universe from Chaos and quickly covers the children of Gaia, the rise of the Titans, and the triumph of the Olympians. The origins of each of the Olympians, their symbols, and their characters are briefly described. James does not neglect the less-well-known deities. The gods of wind, rivers, and oceans are included, as well as other immortals, such as Atlas and Medea. Lists of the gods' children are followed by an index of 3000-plus individuals. When the book is turned over, it opens to a large map of the Aegean Sea, showing the places associated with mythic heroes. This begins the genealogical chart of the mortals who participated in the Trojan War, starting with their immortal ancestors and concluding with their descendants. A map of the Mediterranean Sea shows the routes of the Argonauts, Aeneas, and Odysseus. Lists of Helen's suitors, the 12 labors of Hercules, and more conclude the volume. James used a variety of Greek and Roman sources. When presented with conflicting accounts, she gave preference to Greek writers. The retellings are necessarily brief, and there are omissions. This book would supplement standard guides such as those by Edith Hamilton and Thomas Bulfinch. Traditional mythology books include modern engravings or no art at all.The appeal here is in the beauty of the more than 125 color photographs of Greek and Roman artwork, the concise biographies, and the elegant ordering of a complex topic.<i>-Kathy Tewell, Chantilly Regional Library, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The idea of a woman being involved in the murkiness of criminal detection must have seemed a radical and adventurous one in Victorian times: women simply did not do that sort of thing. And yet, in 1864, to the delight of men and women alike, two male authors published novels starring a female detective.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Stephens Hayward published <i>Revelations of a Lady Detective</i> just six months after Andrew Forrester&#x2019;s <i>The Female Detective</i> (republished by the British Library in 2012), making Hayward&#x2019;s the second novel ever published to feature a female detective. Hayward&#x2019;s heroine, Mrs. Paschal, is a very different character from her predecessor, Forrester&#x2019;s G. For a start, Mrs. Paschal is shown smoking on the front cover&#x2014;an activity considered very modern and daring for women, even in the late nineteenth century. She is a widow, left close to financial ruin by the death of her husband, and supports herself through her detective work. This much racier female detective is however equally inventive, intuitive, and insightful, and with a Colt revolver in hand she works her way through a variety of cases involving theft, murder, and kidnapping.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This very rare novel will be welcomed by all fans of Victorian crime fiction.<br></p><p><b>William Stephens Hayward</b> (1835&#x2013;70) was a prolific author of Victorian &#x201c;sensation&#x201d; novels, historical novels, and stories for boys&#x2019; papers.

As D-day approaches in Europe, the Allied command learns of a German staff conference to be held in Brittany at the Chateau de Voincourt, where the Nazis will discuss their Atlantic Wall defense strategy. Foreknowledge of these plans could mean the difference between success and failure for the Allied invasion, and as luck would have it, the chateau happens to be the home of an undercover French Resistance agent, beautiful Anne-Marie Trevaunce, so there is every chance that the good guys will succeed in stealing them. When Anne-Marie is incapacitated, luck comes to the fore once again: she just happens to have an identical twin sister living in England who is persuaded to take her place. Fortuitous turns are the norm in this improbable story, as cardboard heroes pull off miraculous rescues, double agents lurk everywhere and villains in uniform serve on both sides of the conflict. The author's reputation for entertaining thrillers will not be enhanced by this effort. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>An American Hero: The Red Adair Story : An Authorized Biography</h2><p>Chronicles the sixty-year career of Red Adair, an American who began extinguishing blazes in the Texas oil fields in the 1920s and continues to fight massive oil fires in the Middle East</p><p>This life story of Paul Neal (Red) Adair, an extraordinary good ol' Texas boy, is interspersed with, and overshadowed by, stories of the famous oil well fires he extinguished from Arkansas to the Southeast Asian peninsula of Malaya.

Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let them rest at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes.</p> <p>2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. </p> <p>3. In a large saut� pan, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat and when hot, add the shallots and cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until soft. Add the spinach to the pan and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring, or until the spinach just wilts. Do not let it get too limp. Remove the pan from the heat, cover to keep warm, and set aside. </p> <p>4. In a small saut� pan, heat the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter over medium-low heat and cook the garlic for 2 to 3 minutes or until it begins to brown. Set aside. </p> <p>5. Lightly sprinkle the steaks with salt and pepper.</p> <p>6. In another large saut� pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and when very hot, sear the steaks for about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer the steaks to a roasting pan and roast for 3 to 4 minutes or until barely medium-rare.</p> <p>7. Remove the steaks from the oven and turn on the broiler.</p> <p>8. Drain the liquid from the spinach and spread the spinach in a broiler pan. Set the steaks on top of the spinach and then top each steak with the garlic and butter.

Erikson is winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.</p><p>A winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, Erik H. Erikson was renowned worldwide as teacher, clinician, and theorist in the field of psychoanalysis and human development.This addition to the literature on aging focuses on the need for the elderly to remain vitally involved in the present. In the first chapter Erikson outlines his now famous theory of the eight-stage life cycle. Chapter two consists of often repetitious reflections on the results of interviews with 29 octogenarians from the Berkeley, California area. The third chapter is a reworking of a previously published essay exploring the life history of the protagonist depicted in Bergman's film classic Wild Strawberries.

In clear, easy-to-understand terms, this book dispels the myths that pregnancy and birth are fraught with risk. Lothian and DeVries offer solidly researched evidence to document that common medical interventions (such as pitocin, epidural block, c-sections, IV fluids, and electronic fetal monitoring) often have the effect of putting both mother and baby at greater risk than an intervention-free or "normal" childbirth. In collaboration with Lamaze International, the authors bring decades of professional and personal experience backed by strong research support their views on preparing women for childbirth.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>iParenting Media Awards 2006 Excellent Product Winner: Parenting</b></p><p></p></p><p>Judith Lothian is a nurse and childbirth educator with over 30 years of experience.

The SS <i>hauptmann</i> standing guard at the door snapped his arm upward in a salute and shouted as a heavy cement truck rolled by.<br>"Field Marshal Keitel. Der f�hrer is expecting you. Since they are reinforcing the command bunker, the conference will be held in Minister Speer's barracks."<br>"Very well," the aristocratic commander replied. His face was etched with deep lines, and black circles darkened the skin around his eyes. Keitel turned to one of his accompanying officers and glanced down at the man's solid briefcase. "Did you bring the information on the Replacement Army?"<br>Colonel Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg instantly tightened his grip on the satchel's handle. He stood stiffly, nearly as tall as the field marshal, and was every bit his equal as an aristocrat if not in military rank. Von Stauffenberg was a soldier who had suffered grievously for the Reich. A black path covered his left eye, and his sleeve on the same side was pinched shut at the wrist, hanging empty beside his Wehrmacht colonel's tunic. He clasped his large briefcase in his right hand, even though he had lost fingers there to the same explosion that had claimed his arm and his eye. "<i>Jawohl</i>," he replied, indicating the briefcase with a nod. (He was sweating for reasons other than the oppressive heat.)<br>The colonel glanced over at the footings for the new large command bunker, a symptom of the Soviet advance. A foreman was yelling at his crew; as always, Wolfschanze, the "Wolf's Lair," was a beehive of construction activity, with new fortifications being thrown up while the war moved closer and closer.<br>Keitel noticed Stauffenberg looking at the new command bunker. 'The tide will yet turn in our direction," the field marshal observed.<br>Stauffenberg looked at his commander. "Yes, Field Marshal," he replied. "And perhaps sooner than we think." His face was carefully expressionless, giving away nothing of his true thoughts. Only the beads of moisture on his forehead betrayed his tension, and those could easily be explained by the heat. He knew Keitel was still loyal to the f�hrer and would be until the end--which would come sooner than the field marshal could possibly imagine.<br>Minutes before, Stauffenberg had opened the briefcase and reached inside to crush a glass ampule. The subsequent chemical reaction had activated a fuse. By the colonel's estimate, the bomb in the briefcase would go off in about ten minutes. If all went well, by the end of the day Germany would begin to emerge from the long night of dictatorship and fascism.<br>Keitel merely nodded, obviously pleased at the patriotic response, as he led his staff toward the barracks. Twice, staff officers offered to carry Stauffenberg's briefcase, but each time he refused the help. The seconds crept slowly by as they approached the Speer Barracks. This was one of the old wooden structures, built before fortifications at the Wolf's Lair were deemed necessary. The building looked like a long one-story lodge in the woods, not at all like a sophisticated field headquarters for the mighty military machine that was the Third Reich.<br>To von Stauffenberg, the change raised a pragmatic concern. He worried that his bomb might not be sufficient for the job, that the open windows would diffuse the blast and reduce the damage it would cause. He suppressed a grimace. Why had Keitel interrupted him before he could get the second bomb from Haeften? But there was nothing to be done about that now.<br>Inside the conference room more than a dozen uniformed officers stood about in various states of unease while an equal number of stenographers scribbled their notes at writing tables placed haphazardly around the perimeter of the conference bunker. A broad map table filled the center of the room, and the short, dark-haired figure of the f�hrer bent over those sheets, his shoulders and arms tight with barely-concealed tension. He looked up, piercing eyes flashing angrily, as Keitel and Stauffenberg entered.<br>General Adolf Heusinger was clearly trying to complete his briefing without provoking another Hitler outburst. "The attempts to reform Army Group Center are being met with some..., er, limited success. Zhukov's armies continue to advance, however. Three days ago some elements of the First Guards Tank Army crossed the Bug River into Poland--although the defenders of Lvov stand heroically firm. In the north, I regret to report, there is a real possibility that Stalin's horde will reach the Baltic. In that case, our armies in Latvia and Estonia will be lost...unless...or rather, if, they were to make a strategic movement toward the Fatherland--"<br>"The German army will never withdraw! It will fight and be victorious--or it will die! But it will never retreat." He was sweating for reasons other than the oppressive heat. Hitler's voice rose nearly to a shriek, his eyes fastened on the quivering lieutenant general. "How is it that you cowards in the Wehrmacht can't get that fact through your thick heads? Proceed--but do not mention withdrawal!"<br>"<i>Jawohl, mein F�hrer</i>!" Heusinger gulped and mopped his brow, then continued with the dolorous report, trying unsuccessfully to highlight the rare bits of positive news.<br>Stauffenberg felt some sympathy for the man, knowing that the task of sugarcoating the news was virtually impossible. In truth, Army Group Center--the greatest concentration of men and mat�riel ever gathered under German command--had been virtually obliterated by the massive Soviet spring offensive. About the best the hapless Heusinger could do was dangle the hope that the sweeping Soviet advance must surely be carrying the Russian tanks far beyond their bases of supply. Also, he emphasized, the bridgehead across the Bug was still small. Of course, none of the unspoken realities would escape any of the experienced army officers here, but these professional soldiers knew to a man that it was nothing short of suicide to confront the f�hrer with truths he did not wish to hear.<br>Stauffenberg, stepped up to the table as Field Marshal Keitel moved to Hitler's side. The colonel had asked Major von Freyend to find him a place close to Hitler to compensate for his poor hearing, and von Freyend was happy to oblige. Stauffenberg's one good eye never blinked as it appeared to consider every detail on the wide map, with its huge expanse of flags and colored lines, the sweeping horde beneath the hammer and sickle closing onto the heart of the Reich. His heart pounded, and anger and despair writhed together as he observed this graphic depiction of national catastrophe. <i>So this is the end to which the f�hrer would lead us. Well, today, right here, the madness stops</i>.<br>The colonel carefully set his heavy briefcase down underneath the table. Months of stealth, of plotting, of careful recruiting had led to this moment. The explosion would kill most of the people in the barracks, he knew, and not all of them deserved to die, but then so many people had not deserved to die. These deaths, at least, would bring the insanity to an end.<br>"Herr Oberst--there is a call for you, from Berlin." Stauffenberg turned to see a messenger whispering at his side. "General Fellgiebel said it was urgent." Nodding silently, the crippled officer took one last look at Adolf Hitler, f�hrer of the Third Reich, and smiled his tight smile before following the messenger from the conference hut, moving quickly across the compound toward the communications building, following the cue of his coconspirator. He completely forgot his cap and gunbelt.<br>He didn't forget his briefcase. It remained exactly where he wanted it, under the table, a few feet from the f�hrer's legs.<br>Colonel Heinz Brandt moved into the space at the table vacated by Stauffenberg. Brandt, an aide to General Heusinger, was an operations officer on the general staff. He was pondering a disturbing bit of news. Unconfirmed reports from the Balkans had been coming into the OKW headquarters, indicating the possibility of defection by Rumania and Bulgaria. The two nations had never been enthusiastic participants in the epic was against the USSR, and now that the eastern hordes rolled toward them, Brandt's sources indicated that either or both countries might be preparing to change sides.<br>Yet how could he bring this up to the f�hrer? Brandt's idealism and patriotism had been sorely tried these past months. He still revered his f�hrer, but those bursts of temper were coming more and more frequently. And too often they meant disgrace or disaster to the recipient.<br>His position at the table was awkward, and he realized that his foot was blocked by Stauffenberg's briefcase. He reached down to move the leather satchel to his right, finding that it was surprisingly heavy. As he started to shove it behind the thick stanchion supporting the table, however, he was possessed by the sudden urge to sneeze. He froze, embarrassed by his awkward stance, tense because of his proximity to Hitler. Struggling to suppress the tickle in his nose--a distraction such as a sneeze, however involuntary, always irritated the f�hrer--Brandt decided that the briefcase could remain where it was. He straightened with careful dignity, ignoring the damnably heavy satchel, relieved that he managed to keep from attracting unwanted attention to himself.<br>More ominous facts and figures mounted up: the Americans and British continued to reinforce their beachhead in Normandy, which was now six weeks old. The German defenders held their positions with heroic courage, but the <i>Wehrmacht</i> commander in the west, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, had just been critically injured by an Allied air attack. The report sent by his replacement, von Kluge, indicated that his troops were stretched to the breaking point, that the defensive shell must soon crack.<br>Meanwhile the heavy bombers kept coming, day and night, raining death on Germany's cities and destruction upon the Third Reich's industrial capabilities. Reichsmarschall Hermann G�ring's representative reluctantly admitted that the Luftwaffe was horribly depleted, critically short of spare parts, barely able to scrape together enough fighters to harass the thundering fleets of enemy bombers.<br>Hitler's eyes again flashed. "And the rigging of the jet bombers? How fares that?"<br>The unfortunate Luftwaffe officer paused awkwardly. Like every other former combat pilot, he undoubtedly realized the potential of the rocket-fast plane designed by Willy Messerschmidt--the Me-262. Certainly it was glaringly obvious to him, and to everyone else in the Luftwaffe, that the short-ranged aircraft would make a magnificent fighter. Still, Hitler felt a passionate need to strike back at the enemy homeland in revenge for the bombing of Germany, and to that end he had insisted that the aircraft be rigged to carry bombs--a task for which the plane was patently unfit. Thus, the development of a premier weapon had been placed indefinitely on hold. Brandt, an army man more familiar with diplomacy than air power, nevertheless felt sympathy for the flying officer who was now forced to confront his ruler's irrationality.<br>The man would never formulate his reply.<br>The explosion ripped through the confined space with the deafening power of thunder, a blaze of fiery light and a shock-wave that twisted the ground itself. An eruption of smoke and debris choked Brandt, who suddenly found himself lying on his back, staring up at the tattered remnants of the ceiling's crude wooden paneling. Patches of sky showed through the lumber, a fact that struck him as bizarre.<br>What had happened? The colonel couldn't fully grasp the situation. Looking around, blinking the dust of the explosion from his eyes, he saw Field Marshal Keitel stagger past. The tall man's hair stood on end, and his face was plastered with soot as he knelt beside a shapeless form to Brandt's left. Other officers groaned or cried for help while two stenographers stumbled toward the door, which hung limply by a single hinge.<br>Idly, with a sense of curious detachment, Colonel Brandt dropped a hand below his own waist, noticing that his legs were gone. He was dying, he realized, though it was a distant thought. The horrific wound didn't seem to hurt, a fact that surprised him. He noticed a leather shred, the same color as the heavy briefcase, fluttering in the ruins of the smoke-filled room.<br>Then he saw Keitel lurch to his feet, the field marshal's face distorted with a grief so strong that it penetrated even Brandt's mortal haze. Rubbing a hand across the blasted skin of his face, the chief of staff tried unsuccessfully to conceal his profound distress. His jaw stretched tight by emotion, the field marshal's words caught in his throat. He looked down again, as if to deny some madness that afflicted his mind. Finally, haltingly, he spoke.<br>"<i>Der f�hrer ist tot</i>," Keitel declared, his voice as dull as the echoes of the assassin's bomb.<br>* * *<br>General Erich Fellgiebel, standing outside the Speer Barracks, spun around in alarm as the sound of the explosion echoed through the Wolf's Lair. For a moment his mind froze in awful, incomprehensible fear. <i>What have we done</i>? The question resounded through his mind until he roughly pushed it aside. <i>We have taken back the Fatherland</i>!<br>The older general's mind still churned with the conflict between his military oath and his duty to his country as he saw it. It was a difficult choice, a bitter draught from a cup he'd wished would have passed him by. History might brand him a traitor, an oath breaker, and the thought of his reputation forever stained by betrayal was almost too much to bear. He admired the younger Stauffenberg's stoicism, his aristocratic certainty that his choice was correct, honorable.<br>He watched the dust cloud trailing Stauffenberg's staff car as the colonel and his driver drove away from the Wolf's Lair without apparent urgency. His coconspirator would board an aircraft for Berlin within a few minutes. Not so long ago he'd thought of the young officer as almost a son. Now, in the end, it seemed as if their roles had reversed. <i>May God be with him...and with the Fatherland</i>.<br>Fellgiebel knew that he had his own mission to carry out, but now that the time had come the general's will strangely deserted him. He knew he had only minutes to live.<br>"Treachery! Murder! Help--bring the surgeon!" The cries came from the destroyed staff building, and several officers stumbled into the sunlight, caked with dust and debris. Was Hitler among them?<br>Fellgiebel gawked, frozen in place, feeling the pulse pounding in his temples. Had they succeeded? What should he do?<br>"The f�hrer is slain!" gasped one general, falling to his knees in shock or despair.<br>In that admission Fellgiebel found his strength and darted through the door of the communications center. Idle couriers stared in surprise as the general pulled open a large case, withdrawing several long hand grenades. Holding the fragmentation bombs in one hand, he drew his pistol with the other. the wide-eyed radio operator lurched to his feet, staring at the general in disbelief, which the two operators sp...</p><h2>The Practice of Social Research [Paperback] Babbie, Earl R</h2><p>The Practice of Social Research-Cengage Learning-Earl R.

She is also the author of a number of critically acclaimed novels, including Prairie Songs, a 1986 ALA Best Children's Book of the Year and a 1985 ALA Golden Kite Honor Book, and <i> Stonewords, </i> winner of the 1991 Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Juvenile Mystery.PreSchool-Grade 3-This enchanting sequel to The Tub People (HarperCollins, 1989) has it all-suspense, adventure, and romance. Leaving the bathroom behind, the Tub People have taken up residence in a cozy room with a green braided rug. During one of their games, a ball rolls beneath the radiator and the Tub Child discovers a man sleeping on his side. "'Walter, dear, is that you?'" asks the Tub Grandmother, and the stanger is identified as the long-lost but not forgotten Tub Grandfather. Dusted off and set upright, the wooden man stands silently, stiff and unmoving. Only when the radiator begins to whistle "like an old tune," and the Tub Grandmother hums in his ear, does he respond. It's a sentimental reunion, as the two of them waltz across the rug. Conrad uses deceptively simple language to lead readers through a wonderful range of emotions, building carefully to the climactic moment. This book has a larger format than the first, and the illustrations are sharper and more vibrantly colored. Dramatic closeups add to the mystery of the wooden faces, which seem at once emotional and emotionless. Egielski constructs a variety of moods through a clever use of perspective and the careful positioning of the figures in each scene. It is easy to care for these characters, with their simple but pleasureful pursuits and their obvious affection for one another.<br><i>Joy Fleishhacker, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>NIrV, New Testament for Children, Paperback</h2><p><p>The NIrV New Testament for Children combines the easy-to-read text of the New International Reader&#x2019;s Version (NIrV), color illustrations, and call-out Scripture passages to encourage children to engage with the New Testament.&nbsp; The New International Reader&#x2019;s Version (NIrV) is written at a third-grade reading level, making it the ideal Bible for young readers.</p></p><p></p><h2>L.A. Huffman: Photographer of the American West</h2><p>Frontier photographer L. A. Huffman (1854 1931) captured the spirit of the American West like no other artist. As comfortable photographing the haunting images of the plains Indians as he was the working cowboy, Huffman accurately recorded a passing way of life on the American western frontier. Arriving in Fort Keogh, Montana Territory, in 1879, ten years before Montana would become a state, Huffman realized the importance of recording the end of the open range, the untamed western landscapes, the plains Indian, and the last of the buffalo herds. While many painters and photographers created art that romanticized the West, Huffman photographed everyday life, ranging from ranching and hunting scenes to landscapes of Yellowstone National Park. While living in Miles City, Montana, he captured unique images of frontiersmen, cowboys, Native Americans, soldiers, and city folk from the area.

There they began a strenuous and thrilling hundred-day field trip around the edge of the continent. Part travelogue, part epic natural adventure, their richly illustrated record is &#34;the superlatively good product of ideal circumstances&#34; (Chicago Sunday Tribune).</p><p>In 1953 renowned American ornithologist and painter Roger Tory Peterson and British seabird specialist James Fisher undertook a whirlwind, 100-day tour of America&#39;s great wildlife refuges and corridors. This wonderful book recounts that sometimes madcap voyage, which took them to familiar places such as Long Island and the Smoky Mountains, but also to less traveled venues such as Big Bend and the then-remote Everglades. Along the way the authors document such things as the courting behavior of dragonflies and the arrival of the first cattle egrets in North America. This is a classic of nature writing and a great pleasure to read.ROGER TORY PETERSON, one of the world&#x2019;s greatest naturalists, received every major award for ornithology, natural science, and conservation as well as numerous honorary degrees, medals, and citations, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

He portrays dogs in bed watching TV, dressed up as an elephant or a frog, on roller skates, etc. These jokey pictures have won him a reputation as a humorist and post-modernist commentator on art. Of greater interest are his send-ups of Caravaggio and his almost cartoon-like photographs of everyday scenes or objects. Edited by Kunz, former director of the Kunstmuseum in Switzerland, this catalogue of a traveling exhibition exhaustively surveys Wegman's photos and lighthearted videotapes; his "consistently banal" drawings, which make "a kind of anti-statement"; and his paintings, which "lure the viewer into the anxiety that Kierkegaard called 'the dizziness of freedom.' " That's a tall claim for loose, often derivative canvases. Wegman scores most effectively as a deflater of the seriousness of conceptual and minimal art. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Wind in the Willows</h2><p>The animals who live in River Bank invite us to follow them as they scamper about, make friends, have fun, and get into trouble, just as people do.

When it comes to law and order, East Texas plays by its own rules - a fact that Darren Mathews, a black Texas Ranger working the backwoods towns of Highway 59, knows all too well. Deeply conflicted about his home state, he was the first in his family to get as far away from Texas as he could. Until duty called him back. So when allegiance to his roots puts his job in jeopardy, he travels up Highway 59 to the small town of Lark, where two murders - a black lawyer from Chicago and a local white woman - have stirred up a hornet&#39;s nest of resentment. Darren must solve the crimes - and save himself in the process - before Lark&#39;s long-simmering racial fault lines erupt. &#39;In Bluebird, Bluebird Attica Locke had both mastered the thriller and exceeded it. Ranger Darren Mathews is tough, honor-bound, and profoundly alive in corrupt world. I loved everything about this book.&#39; Ann Patchett &#39;Locke&#39;s writing is both sharp-edged and lyrical. This is thoughtful, piercing storytelling with the power to transport.&#39; Diana Evans, Financial Times</p><p>Attica Locke is the author of Pleasantville, which won the 2016 Harper Lee Prize for Legal Fiction and was short-listed for the Baileys Women&#39;s Prize for Fiction; Black Water Rising, which was nominated for an Edgar Award; and The Cutting Season, a national bestseller and winner of the Ernest Gaines Award for Literary Excellence.

The best crime novel of the year so far. -- Paul Connolly * Metro * What is most satisfying about this crime novel is its use of the crime as a device with which to explore something much larger and universal ... Locke&#39;s writing is both sharp-edged and lyrical. This is thoughtful, piercing storytelling with the power to transport. -- Diana Evans * FT * Elegant ... gripping. -- Claire Kohda Hazelton * Observer * Cracking ... The prose is beautifully rhythmic ... Locke uses her insider knowledge of the area to really get under the skin of her characters, in the process revealing the real beating heart of rural Texan life. It&#39;s uncomfortable stuff at times, but it&#39;s brilliantly executed. * Big Issue * Memorable characters, engaging prose and a soundtrack of down-home blues make for a winning literary crime thriller. -- Jeffrey Burke * Mail on Sunday * Page-turning. * Elle * Ms. Locke is a wonderful stylist, able to conjure vivid impressions with a single phrase. * Wall Street Journal * Locke is a brisk writer with a sharp eye for the subtleties of how rural white Southerners tend to act as if their little towns belong to them - and react harshly to black independence. * Washington Post * In Bluebird, Bluebird Attica Locke had both mastered the thriller and exceeded it. Ranger Darren Mathews is tough, honor-bound, and profoundly alive in corrupt world. I loved everything about this book. -- Anne Patchett, author of Commonwealth This is the best kind of thriller: as literate and thoughtful as it is fast-moving. Attica Locke has bags of style, and sings the blues on every page. A highlight of the year so far, and the curtain-raiser for what promises to be a compelling series. -- Mick Herron, author of Slow Horses With Bluebird, Bluebird Attica Locke brings freshness and vitality to a beloved form. Her storytelling touch is just so strong! From the first beautifully done scene until the finale, this is a very propulsive novel concerning old deeds that keep influencing the present, injustice and courage - a powerful and dramatic look at contemporary black life in rural America. -- Daniel Woodrell, author of Winter&#39;s Bone Attica Locke knows Texas, a place that has shaped both her characters and her life. Locke&#39;s new book, Bluebird, Bluebird, is evidence of her deep knowledge and love of her community and a deep talent for writing hype thrillers that also manage to be timely, relevant and keenly insightful. -- Joe Ide, author of IQ and Righteous Bluebird, Bluebird has the impeccable pacing, memorable characters, and deepening sense of mystery and dread we expect in the finest noir thrillers. But this is so much more. Attica Locke has written a marvelous novel. -- Ron Rash, author of The Risen Attica Locke has built a career on political novels wrapped in the conventions of the crime thriller, and Bluebird, Bluebird burnishes an already impressive reputation. * Irish Times * Attica Locke is a must-read author who writes with power, grace, and heart, and Bluebird, Bluebird is a remarkable achievement. This is a rare novel that thrills, educates, and inspires all at once. Don&#39;t miss it. -- Michael Koryta, author of Rise the Dark Attica Locke knows how to tell a tale, her voice so direct and crisp that the dust from the side of Highway 59 will settle on your hands as you hold Bluebird, Bluebird. Nothing comes easy in Shelby County, where the lines between right and wrong blur a little more with each heartfelt page, and love and pain live together as one under the big Texas sun. -- Michael Farris Smith, author of Desperation Road and Rivers Incisive ... Locke&#39;s superior storytelling excels in Bluebird, Bluebird as the author deftly moves the brisk plot that centres on racism as well as greed, hate and even love. -- Oline Cogdill * Associated Press * Attica Locke&#39;s Bluebird, Bluebird reads like a blues song to East Texas with all its troubles over property, race, and love. Taut where it has to be to keep a murder investigation on its toes, this novel is also languid when you need to understand just what would keep a black woman or man in a place where so much troubled history lies. This novel marks Love&#39;s (and Hatred&#39;s) comings and goings amongst black and white, and all the shades between. Locke&#39;s small town murder investigation reveals what lies at the heart of America&#39;s confusion over race. -- Walter Mosley, author of Down the River unto the Sea This is Attica Locke&#39;s best work yet-and if you&#39;ve read Pleasantville you know that&#39;s saying something. Just by her choice of protagonist (an African American Texas Ranger, tacking between two worlds as he solves a double homicide) you know Locke is a writer who makes bold choices, and whose fiction is powerfully connected to our troubled world -- Ben Winters, author of Underground Airlines A rich sense of place and relentless feeling of dread permeate Attica Locke&#39;s heartbreakingly resonant new novel about race and justice in America. . . . an emotionally dense and intricately detailed thriller, roiling with conflicting emotions steeped in this nation&#39;s troubled past and present * USA Today * Attica Locke pens a poignant love letter to the lazy red-dirt roads and Piney Woods that serve as a backdrop to a noir thriller as murky as the bayous . . She is adept at crafting characters who don&#39;t easily fit the archetypes of good and evil, but exist in the thick grayness of humanness -- Houston Chronicle Praise for Pleasantville: &#39;Ambitious, socially committed and beautifully written ... the next time you find yourself in the company of a crime reviewer, don&#39;t bother asking who you should be reading. You know the answer: Attica Locke. -- Barry Forshaw * Independent * An excellent thriller ... a gripping blend of the personal and the political * Irish Times * As convincing as it is enthralling. -- Boyd Hilton * Heat * Genuinely unnerving ... subtle, complex questions of identity, family and history * Daily Mail * Outstanding...Locke just gets better and better as a writer. -- Jake Kerridge * Sunday Express Magazine * Her best story yet. -- Mark Lawson * Guardian * It&#39;s a fascinatingly complex setting and Locke maps it with great skill, charting the struggles of her characters as the crime remains unsolved ... a smart legal thriller about how far people will go to gain power, and keep it. -- Jeff Noon * Spectator * A common selling point for the sorely missed HBO series &#34;The Wire&#34; is that it&#39;s the closest television has ever come to feeling like a novel. Attica Locke&#39;sPleasantville is that novel. * Washington Independent Review of Books * In Pleasantville, Attica Locke returns to Jay Porter, the black lawyer hero of her magnificent first novel, Black Water Rising. This one is just as good. -- Marcel Berlins * Times * Outstandingly good ... Locke uses language with unusual elegance and her characters spring lifelike from the page. What is more, her writing deserves attention from historians and sociologists: her portrayal of race relations in the one-time slave-owning states is vivid, subtle and tragic. * Literary Review * Sharp and moody -- Adam Sternbergh * Shortlist *</p><h2>Enid Blytons Christmas Stories</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Enid Blyton&#39;s books have sold over 500 million copies and have been translated into other languages more often than any other children&#39;s author.

Wonderfully readable, <b>The Bard </b>catches Burns&#x2019;s energy, brilliance and radicalism as never before. <br><br>To his international admirers he was a genius, a hero, a warm-hearted friend; yet to the mother of one of his lovers he was a wastrel; to a fellow poet he was &#x201c;sprung . . . from raking of dung;&#x201d; and to his political enemies a &#x201c;traitor.&#x201d; Drawing on a surprising variety of untapped sources &#x2014; from rediscovered poetry by Burns to manuscript journals, correspondence, interviews and oratory by his contemporaries &#x2014; this new biography presents the remarkable life, loves, and struggles of the great poet. Robert Crawford outlines how Burns combined a childhood steeped in the peasant song-culture of rural Scotland with a consummate linguistic artistry to become not only the world&#x2019;s most popular love poet but also the controversial master poet of modern democracy.<br><br>Written with accessible �lan and nuanced attention to Burns&#x2019;s poems and letters, <b>The Bard</b> is the story of an extraordinary man fighting to maintain a sly sense of integrity in the face of overwhelming pressures.

Compelling and timely, this book directs attention to a major poet who has been scandalously neglected in scholarship outside of Scotland for many years."<b>--James Chandler, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"There have been scores if not hundreds of biographies of Burns.

In Mrs. Darroch&#39;s favor is the fact that this is the first biography of the divine Ottoline and that if you can overlook all the sublime/ridiculous things said about her (as well as her own effusions in the second volume of her memoirs edited by Gathorne-Hardy, p. 746), Mrs. Darroch has managed to restitute some measure of respect and liking for her. Certainly she was the victim of a vendetta of small talk and the butt of endless witticisms. Six feet tall, topped with titian hair, and swaddled in eccentric garb, she looked like, as Gertrude Stein said, &#34;&#34;a marvellous female version of Disraeli.&#34;&#34; She was also by inclination more than just a hostess to the great; by intention she was what used to be called their divine afflatus. Among her constantly changing circle of admirers, from Augustus John and Axel Munthe at the beginning to Eliot at the close, were three who were paramount: Russell, who after years of abstinence with Alys, pursued her with his fierce nature and pyorrhetic teeth; Lytton Strachey, almost &#34;&#34;part of the furniture&#34;&#34;; and Lawrence who, sparked by Frieda, managed to destroy her to some degree. . . . All her acts of kindness--some of them were genuine--forgotten, all those voltes-face. Mrs. Darroch has based her story on the official correspondence, now in Austin, Texas, and handles it with gentle amusement, good taste and sympathy. For all of that Lady Ottoline remains a peacock feather bizarrerie.</p><p></p><h2>Cooks Illustrated 2005 Annual</h2><p>Perfect for long-term reference, the Cook&#39;s Illustrated 2005 Annual contains all six of the 2005 issues complete in their original form, plus a master recipe and article index.

The impossible and destructive triangle of Anna, her husband Karenin, and her lover Vronsky, is set against the marriage of Levin and Kitty, illuminating the most important questions which beset humanity. This edition uses Louise and Aylmer Maude's classic translation--still unsurpassed--and is printed here with a new introduction and detailed annotation.</p><p>Some people say <i>Anna Karenina</i> is the single greatest novel ever written, which makes about as much sense to me as trying to determine the world's greatest color. But there is no doubt that <i>Anna Karenina</i>, generally considered Tolstoy's best book, is definitely one ripping great read. Anna, miserable in her loveless marriage, does the barely thinkable and succumbs to her desires for the dashing Vronsky. I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say that 19th-century Russia doesn't take well to that sort of thing.A beautiful society wife from St. Petersburg, determined to live life on her own terms, sacrifices everything to follow her conviction that love is stronger than duty. A socially inept but warmhearted landowner pursues his own visions instead of conforming to conventional views. The adulteress and the philosopher head the vibrant cast of characters in <i>Anna Karenina,</i> Tolstoy's tumultuous tale of passion and self-discovery.<br>This novel marks a turning point in the author's career, the juncture at which he turned from fiction toward faith. Set against a backdrop of the historic social changes that swept Russia during the late nineteenth century, it reflects Tolstoy's own personal and psychological transformation. Two worlds collide in the course of this epochal story: that of the old-time aristocrats, who struggle to uphold their traditions of serfdom and authoritarian government, and that of the Westernizing liberals, who promote technology, rationalism, and democracy. This cultural clash unfolds in a compelling, emotional drama of seduction, betrayal, and redemption.</p><h2>Lonely Planet Hiking in Japan (Travel Guide)</h2><p>Sunrise atop Fuji-san, steaming volcanoes, natural hot springs, ancient temples and pilgrim trails, wild subtropical jungles, spectacular gorges, unique wildlife and nature's seasonal shows - explore the wonders of Japan with this meticulously researched guide.&#x20ac;� detailed trail notes with kanji for more than 70 day and multi-day hikes &#x20ac;� 70 detailed, custom-drawn contour maps with kanji&#x20ac;� accommodation options from gateway cities to remote camp sites &#x20ac;� tips on transport to and from the trailheads&#x20ac;� practical advice on local culture, responsible hiking and pre-hike preparation&#x20ac;� quick reference language section, glossary and gazetteer with kanji</p><p></p><h2>Garfield Rounds Out: His 16th Book</h2><p>On a diet or swallowing a lasagna whole, he&#39;s still the same lovable Garfield.

Examples include OONA, ORT and ESNE.&nbsp;Crossword puzzle:&nbsp;In this book, crossword puzzle refers to standard American-style puzzles.&nbsp;Cryptic crossword puzzle:&nbsp;Cryptic crosswords make up a small portion of American crosswords, but are the primary crossword type in the United Kingdom. Cryptics involve anagramming, hidden words, reversals, homophones, letter deletions and other forms of wordplay. The New York Times Magazine includes about six cryptic puzzles a year, printed below the regular Sunday crossword.&nbsp;Diagramless crossword puzzle:&nbsp;A diagramless crossword grid is Blank, requiring the solver to deduce the location of all the Black squares. General rules governing symmetry, fill and Cluing apply, though diagramless puzzles typically have many more black squares. The New York Times Magazine includes one of these about nine times a year, printed beneath the regular Sunday crossword.&nbsp;Editor:&nbsp;The person who selects crosswords for publication, edits clues to comply with house style, accuracy and the intended level of difficulty, and polishes the fill as needed.&nbsp;Entry:&nbsp;Any answer that's written in a crossword grid.&nbsp;Fill:&nbsp;The general term for the words and phrases that fill a crossword grid. Entries that are not part of a theme are referred to as fill entries.&nbsp;Fill-in-the-blank:&nbsp;A clue that contains a blank space, for which the answer is the word that occupies that space (e.g., ["Many years ___"] for AGO).&nbsp;Gimme:&nbsp;Any answer a solver knows instantly. An opera buff's Gimmes: may differ from a basketball fan's.&nbsp;Grid:&nbsp;The diagram of black and white squares. Most daily puzzles are 15�15 squares; most Sunday puzzles, 21�21.&nbsp;Partial:&nbsp;At times, two words that cannot stand alone are used in the grid. The clue for a partial may be a fill-in-the-Blank: (e.g., [Take ___ (suffer loss)] for A HIT) or something like [Break or time follower] for OF DAY. In The New York Times, partials generally do not exceed five letters.&nbsp;Rebus:&nbsp;In New York Times crossword circles, "rebus" can mean not only a crossword square occupied by a little picture (say, a triangle or bell) or symbol (such as @ replacing the letters AT), but also any sequence of letters that fill a single square.&nbsp;Solver:&nbsp;A crossword consumer. Solvers may work alone or with others. Use of reference books and online resources is a matter of personal preference.&nbsp;Symmetry:&nbsp;Standard crosswords have 180� rotational symmetry, though occasionally left/right symmetry is used.&nbsp;Theme:&nbsp;A crossword theme consists of several longer entries that have something in common with one another.&nbsp;Themeless:&nbsp;A crossword with no theme entries is called themeless. In The New York Times, most Friday and Saturday crosswords are themeless.&nbsp;Triple-stack:&nbsp;In some themeless puzzles, three 15-letter entries that span the entire grid from left to right or top to bottom are stacked together. Crosswords with triple-stacks are difficult to construct but often easier to solve than other themeless puzzles.&nbsp;Understanding Crossword Themes&nbsp;Most New York Times crosswords feature a theme (Friday and Saturday puzzles are generally themeless). Crossword constructors devise many creative new ideas for puzzles, but often they call upon several basic theme varieties. The more common types of themes include the following:&nbsp;categories--The theme entries are phrases or words that have something in common. These might include colloquial phrases that mean the same thing, phrases that can all be defined by the same clue, phrases that start or end with a related set of words, puns that change a word's pronunciation so that all the theme entries have related puns, and more.&nbsp;commemorative--These themes may mark a notable person's birthday, the anniversary of an important event, a holiday or current events. A commemorative crossword may also honor a celebrity who has recently passed away.&nbsp;gimmicks--Gimmicks include twists on the usual conventions of crosswords. They may have rebus squares (see below), the theme entries may run backwards or upwards, certain squares may be left blank, or some words may extend outside the grid. In The New York Times, you'll generally see gimmicks on Thursdays and Sundays more than the other days of the week.&nbsp;letter restriction--A puzzle with a letter-restriction gimmick uses only certain letters of the alphabet--e.g., the only vowel used is E, the letter B is absent from the grid (and clues), only the letters from the left side of a standard keyboard are used, or only the letters in a certain phrase (e.g., CHRISTMAS CAROL) are used.&nbsp;pattern matching--Theme phrases may share a certain letter pattern. A puzzle with a FIND THE LOST DOGS theme included WATER OVER THE BRIDGE, which has a hidden dog name (ROVER) embedded within it; several other dog names were hidden in the other entries. Other pattern-matching themes may contain the same hidden word or letters in each theme entry. Another pattern-matching puzzle contained famous people whose initials were also academic degrees (e.g., PHIL DONAHUE for Ph.D.).&nbsp;quote/quip--A quotation or joke is broken into symmetrical pieces; the author's name may also appear in the theme.&nbsp;rebus--In a crossword with a rebus gimmick, rebus squares contain a picture (face, square, etc.), multiple letters (such as the word UP), numerals (sometimes using the letters in the number's name, such as ONE) or symbols (#, +) instead of the standard single letter.&nbsp;word transformation--This variety of theme may rely on anagramming, word reversals, or adding, removing or changing a letter (or letters) to create theme entries.&nbsp;Copyright � 2007 by The New York Times Company.

Each one claims to be a part of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church of God. Each one seeks to be loyal to Jesus of Nazareth as Savior and Lord. Yet each one is different from the others. For example, most of us are aware of the great difference between the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention of churches. But only those who are closely involved know the subtle differences between one kind of Baptist group and another. This book is not about differences between denominations. It is about the Episcopal Church USA. The Episcopal Church is a member of the family of Anglican Churches whose mother Church is that centered on Canterbury, England. This book is not a history of the Episcopal Church or a statement of its doctrines. Rather, it is the presentation of an attractive and compelling way of understanding the distinctive claim that can and should be made for the Episcopal Church. In one sentence, the claim is that the Episcopal Church is called to be both evangelical and catholic. In other words, the call of God to the Episcopal Church in these times, when the one Church of God is sadly divided, is that it should be simultaneously evangelical and catholic. This doesn&#39;t not mean that she is to be evangelical in her preaching and catholic in her liturgy. It is not a matter of being sometimes evangelical and sometimes catholic. The Church is called to be catholic and evangelical all the time in all that she is and does. The Reverend Dr. Peter Toon (1939-2009) was born in Yorkshire, England, and educated in Hemsworth Grammar School, Yorkshire, Cliff College, Derbyshire, and King&#39;s College, University of London. He was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1973, and taught theology in both England and America, and was also a visiting professor and guest lecturer at a variety of seminaries and universities in Asia, Europe, and Australia.</p><p>Peter Toon (Ph.D., Oxford University) is rector of Christ Church, Biddulph Moor, Diocese of Lichfield, in the Church of England.</p><h2>Autumn of Glory: The Army of Tennessee, 1862-1865</h2><p>Winner of the Fletcher Pratt Award and the Jefferson Davis Award</p><p><p>Thomas Lawrence Connelly, professor of history at the University of South Carolina for many years, was the author or coauthor of numerous books on the Civil War, including The Politics of Command: Factions and Ideas in Confederate Strategy; The Marble Man: Robert E.

In the words of the eminent mathematician Mark Kac, geniuses are of two kinds: the ordinary, and the magicians. Feynman was a magician of the highest caliber. No one could guess how his mind worked, how he could make transcendental leaps of the imagination so fearlessly. A true original, Feynman was both an inspired, Nobel-prize winning pioneer, and a born showman. He never lost sight of his vision of science as "a long history of learning how not to fool ourselves."<br> <em>The Beat of a Different Drum</em> is a superb account of Feynman's life and work, encompassing a singular career that spanned from the detonation of the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos to the frontiers of our understanding of the universe. The first biography to offer deep insight into both Feynman's scientific achievements and his personal life, it is written by Jagdish Mehra. An accomplished physicist and historian of science in his own right, Mehra knew Feynman for thirty years, and their friendship deeply informs all aspects of the book. Feynman invited Mehra to spend three weeks with him shortly before his death in 1988, and after Feynman died, following a ten year battle against cancer, Mehra interviewed almost eighty of his friends and colleagues. They share their recollections of Feynman from his precocious childhood in Queens, New York, to his final days, painting an unforgettable portrait of a scientist who insisted throughout his life on taking the whole of nature as the arena of his science and his imagination. Mehra writes clearly and comprehensively about the theoretical and technical aspects of Feynman's achievements: his crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb; his association with Hans Bethe at Cornell, where he worked out his famous path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics, and went on to develop the Feynman diagrams, so ubiquitous in quantum field theory, elementary particle physics, and statistical mechanics; and the full range and depth of his work from 1950 until shortly before his death at the California Institute of Technology.<br> Here, too, are intimate glimpses into the development of Feynman's inner life, including his devoted relationship with his extraordinary father, a self-taught uniform salesman, and his first marriage, to his boyhood sweetheart, Arline, whom he married knowing that she had only a short time to live. Feynman was an eyewitness to some of this century's key moments of scientific discovery, and Mehra devotes an entire chapter to Feynman's more philosophical reflections on the implications of these discoveries. Flamboyant and impatient, but dedicated to his vision of a better world through cooperation and the fearless pursuit of scientific truth, Feynman emerges here as a genius whom fellow Nobel laureate Julian Schwinger remembered as "an honest man; the outstanding intuitionist of our age and a prime example of what may lie in store for anyone who dares to follow the beat of a different drum."</p><p><br><em>About the author:</em><br> <strong>Jagdish Mehra</strong> is the author of many articles and books on twentieth-centuryphysics, including <em>Einstein, Hilbert, and the Theory of Gravitation</em> and the first five volumes (seven books) of <em>The Historical Development of QuantumTheory</em>, with Helmut Rechenburg.

In 1926 she moved to Stockholm where she found work as a secretary. She did not begin writing until 1944 when, immobilized with a sprained ankle, she began to set down the Pippi Longstocking stories she had invented over the years to entertain her daughter, Karin. Her first book (Britt-Mari Opens Her Heart) was published by Rab�n &amp; Sj�gren that same year, followed by <i>Pippi Longstocking</i> in 1945. Free-spirited and super�naturally strong in all respects, Pippi was an immediate favorite of Swedish schoolchildren, and her popularity only increased with the tales of her adventures that followed. In 1946, Lindgren became an editor and then the head of the children&#x2019;s book department at Rab�n &amp; Sj�gren, a role she held for the next twenty-four years, living in Stockholm and spending summers on her beloved island of Furusund in the Stockholm archipelago. After the Pippi series, Lindgren wrote many fairy tales and picture books, in addition to further chapter books, including <i>Seacrow Island</i> (1964; published by The New York Review Children&#x2019;s Collection) and <i>Ronia, the Robber&#x2019;s Daughter </i>(1981). In addition to writing more than forty children&#x2019;s books, Lindgren published and produced plays and screenplays, and was politically active and lobbied successfully for what became the Animal Protection Act of 1988. She received the Swedish Academy&#x2019;s Gold Medal in 1971 for her contribution to children&#x2019;s literature, and the Dag Hammarskj�ld Award (1984), Albert Schweitzer Medal (1989), and Right Livelihood Award (1994) for her humanitarian efforts. In 2003 the Swedish government created the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award in her honor.<br><b>Ilon Wikland</b> was born in Estonia and came as a refugee to Sweden in 1944.

The authors observed the distinguishing features that made possible a definition of a new &#34;style&#34;: emphasis on volume as opposed to mass; regularity as opposed to symmetry; and dependence on the intrinsic elegance of materials as opposed to applied decoration.

It was a time of telling stories, reciting poetry, selling carpets, and arranging marriages.Then civil war exploded. Their neighborhood found itself on the front line of a conflict that grew more savage by the day.</p><p>With rockets falling around them, Omar's family fled, leaving behind everything they owned to take shelter in an old fort-only a few miles distant and yet a world away from the gunfire. As the violence escalated, Omar's father decided he must take his children out of the country to safety. On their perilous journey, they camped in caves behind the colossal Buddha statues in Bamyan, and took refuge with nomad cousins, herding their camels and sheep. While his father desperately sought smugglers to take them over the border, Omar grew up on the road, and met a deaf-mute carpet weaver who would show him his life's purpose.</p><p>Later, as the Mujahedin war devolved into Taliban madness, Omar learned about quiet resistance. He survived a brutal and arbitrary imprisonment, and, at eighteen, opened a secret carpet factory to provide work for neighborhood girls, who were forbidden to go to school or even to leave their homes. As they tied knots at their looms, Omar's parents taught them literature and science.</p><p>In this stunning coming-of-age memoir, Omar recounts terrifyingly narrow escapes and absurdist adventures, as well as moments of intense joy and beauty.

In 2007, he was a visiting scholar at the University of Colorado. He has studied business at Brandeis University and is currently pursuing an MFA in creative writing at Boston University. Omar has lectured on Afghan carpets in Afghanistan, Europe, and the United States. He is the coauthor, with Stephen Landrigan, of <i>Shakespeare</i> <i>in Kabul</i>.1 <br>&nbsp; <br> <br> <i>In the Time Before</i> <br>In the time before the fighting, before the rockets, before the warlords and their false promises, before the sudden disappearance of so many people we knew to graves or foreign lands, before the Taliban and their madness, before the smell of death hung daily in the air and the ground was soaked in blood, we lived well. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>We have no photos. It was too dangerous to keep them during the time of the Taliban, so we destroyed them. But the images of our lives before all hope fled Afghanistan remain sharp and clear. <br>My mother is wearing her short skirt, sitting in her office in a bank, tending to a long line of customers. She is respected for her knowledge of banking, and her ability to solve people&#x2019;s problems. <br>My father looks like a movie star in his bell-bottom trousers, speeding through the Kabul streets on his motorcycle. Sometimes he ties me to his back with a tight belt. His long hair catches the wind as we ride off. When he turns the corners sharply, the metal guards he wears on his knees shoot sparks into the air as they scrape the pavement. The next day I tell my classmates about that, and make them envious. <br>One of my uncles goes on business trips to other countries. The other uncles and aunts study at universities in Kabul. All of them wear the latest styles. Grandfather, his thick white hair neatly combed, is elegantly dressed in finely tailored suits from Italy that emphasize his affluence. When he enters a room, he dominates it. <br>Grandfather is an impressive man, tall, with broad shoulders. Unlike many other Afghans, he keeps his well-tanned face freshly shaved. It is his wide, black eyes that you notice most. So deep. So commanding. So gentle. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The images come in a rush. Sometimes they play out in little scenes. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>My father is calling me to get ready for school. I open my eyes and look at the clock above my bed. It is too early, but what can I say to him? He is my father. I am his son. Pashtun sons must obey their fathers. <br>But I am not ready to wake up. I rub my eyes. My father keeps calling, &#x201c;Get up! Put on your gloves. I&#x2019;m waiting for you in the ring.&#x201d; He wants me to exercise with him before breakfast. He has started training me to become a famous boxer like himself, and fight as he has in international competitions. <br>I hate waking up early, but I love exercising with my father. He always lets me beat him, even though I am seven years old. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I love school, too. I have perfect attendance. I am smart and popular. Sometimes the boys complain to the headmaster about me when I punch them in their faces. The headmaster covers for me, because he is Grandfather&#x2019;s best friend. But he never smiles at me. <br>My sister and I are in the same school. She is a year and a half older than I, and even smarter and more popular, but she never punches any girls, even though she is the daughter of a well-known boxer. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The heart of our world is my grandfather&#x2019;s house. <br>Grandfather had built it in the late 1960s, when he was the senior accounting officer in the Bank-e-Millie, the National Bank of Afghanistan. The country was prosperous, and he could see that Kabul would outgrow its twisted thousand-year-old streets along the Kabul River. <br>He bought about five acres on the far side of the small, steep mountain with the two peaks that for centuries had protected Kabul on its south and west sides. The land beyond them was then all farms with mud-brick villages, but not for long. <br>Grandfather had studied the land, talked to the farmers who knew it, and carefully chose the piece that had the best well. We had always had water even in the driest months, even when our neighbors had shortages. He enclosed most of his land with a sturdy cement wall, but set part of it aside for a school for all the kids whose families he knew would transform the farmlands into a neighborhood. <br>My father and six of his seven brothers, along with their wives and kids, all lived comfortably within Grandfather&#x2019;s wall. I had more than twenty-five cousins to play with, most of them around my age. Every family had two large rooms of its own. The rooms were clustered in a single-story building on one side of the garden. Grandfather&#x2019;s rooms were on the other side. Between us were sixty McIntosh apple trees. Grandfather&#x2019;s cousin had brought them from America as little branches that he had grafted onto Afghan apple tree roots. They were very rare in Afghanistan, and Grandfather was proud of having them. <br>At one end of the property was a block-long building with two floors of apartments above the shops on the street level. Grandfather rented out the apartments to people who were not relatives. All the windows in the apartments faced the street. No Afghan allows strangers to look into his family&#x2019;s garden. <br>My father set up a gym in one of the shops. Every day after school, dozens of young men would come there to train as boxers. My cousin Wakeel and I would watch them from the sidewalk pounding the punching bag, or doing push-ups, or skipping rope, while my father sparred with one or sometimes two at a time inside the ring he had built. <br>Wakeel was seven years older than I was. He was the older brother I never had. I was the younger brother he always wanted. He let me use him as a punching bag when I imitated the boxers. Every time I hit him, he laughed. <br>Grandfather, by then retired from the bank, used one of the larger shops as a warehouse for his carpets. It had a thick door with a strong lock and was filled with the sweet, lanolin-rich smell of wool. He had thousands of carpets in there. My boy cousins and I liked to jump from one high pile of folded carpets to another. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>All of my uncles had their own businesses, except Wakeel&#x2019;s father. He was a major in the National Army of Afghanistan. He always said, &#x201c;Business is too risky. Most of these businessmen have heart attacks, or die at an early age.&#x201d; He was my grandfather&#x2019;s oldest son, and thus had a special place in the family. He and his wife enjoyed a relaxed life on his army salary with Wakeel, my favorite cousin, and their two daughters. <br>One day he went to his office and never came back. We still do not know whether he is alive or dead. It was in the time when I first heard the word &#x201c;Communists,&#x201d; but I did not know what it meant then. For more than twenty-five years, his wife has been waiting for him to come home. Even now, she runs to the door whenever someone knocks. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>My father was the third son. Like all my uncles, he had only one wife. It was not our family&#x2019;s custom to have more than one. <br>Our neighbors respected my father like a holy man. They came to see him and talked with him about their businesses and their problems. They called him <i>Lala</i>, &#x201c;older brother,&#x201d; even though some of them were older than he was. They told him, &#x201c;Your thoughts are older than your age.&#x201d; He was a man willing to try everything. He had no use for the word &#x201c;no.&#x201d; <br>He was also the only one of his father&#x2019;s sons who was involved in carpets. His five younger brothers saw carpets as something from the past. They were looking to the future, making money in new ways. <br>One was importing goods from Russia. Two others were still in university but looking into importing medicine to sell to pharmacies all over Afghanistan. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Often, we all ate dinner together, more than fifty of us sitting on cushions around one cloth spread on the well-trimmed lawn that Grandfather had sown at one corner of our courtyard. Colorful little lightbulbs hung above us. After dinner, my grandfather and his sons sat in a circle talking about their businesses, or to which universities in Europe or America they should send my boy cousins and me. <br>The women made a separate circle to talk about their own things. It was the responsibility of the older women to find good husbands for the younger ones, such as my father&#x2019;s two unmarried sisters, who lived with us. His two older sisters were already married, and had moved away to the homes of their husbands&#x2019; families in other parts of Kabul. Discussions on suitors could go on for months and involve the whole family until a choice was made. <br>My cousins and I sat in another circle, boys and girls together, telling one another scary tales, and staring at Kabul&#x2019;s clear night sky with the moon and stars scattered across it. When we got tired of stories, we shaped animals from the stars and laughed. <br>Sometimes after we had finished eating, my father or one of my uncles would take the kids around the mountain to buy us ice cream at Shahr-e-Naw Park, or to one of the Kabul movie theaters for an Indian or American film. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Kabul was like a huge garden then. Trees lined the wide streets and touched each other overhead in tall, leafy arches. The city was full of well-tended parks, in which tall pink hollyhocks competed for attention with bright orange marigolds and hundreds of shades of roses. Every house had a garden with pomegranate, almond, or apricot trees. Even the mountain with the two peaks was covered in low-growing weeds and grasses that came to life with the spring rains. In both spring and fall, the sky filled with the brightly colored water birds that rested in the wetlands around the city as they flew between the Russian steppes and India. Ancient underground channels brought water from the mountains, and kept our gardens green. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Every Friday, the Muslim holy day when schools and businesses closed, we carried a large lunch to one of the gardens of our neighbors, or to picnic spots nearby at Qargha Lake or in the Paghman Valley, or sometimes even as far as the Salang Pass, high in the mountains of the Hindu Kush an hour&#x2019;s drive north of Kabul. This was a day for extended families to spend together, visiting and joking and gossiping. <br>My cousins and I climbed hills, while the elders reclined against huge pillows in the shade of willow trees or under the broad leafy branches of a <i>panj chinar</i> tree. My unmarried aunts were kept busy boiling water for the others who drank one cup of tea after another. In these long afternoons they took turns spinning some small event into a big story that made everybody laugh. They all tried to outdo one another, of course. They are Afghans. Of them all, my mother was the best. <br>My uncles were <i>tabla</i> drummers, and my father played the wooden flute, though he had never had lessons. We stayed until late into the evenings, singing, dancing, and cooking over an open fire. <br>Sometimes on these outings, the cousins held a school lessons competition. Whoever got the highest score could demand that the other cousins buy whatever he or she liked, no matter the cost. We, too, were very competitive. Our parents were the judges, and cheered loudly every time one of us got a correct answer. Sometimes the competition ended in a tie. We hated that. <br>Occasionally, some of the cousins fought and did not talk to each other for a day or two. But we could not maintain that for very long. Our games were more important, and never ended, whether we were playing hide-and-seek in the garden, or shooting marbles, or racing our bicycles in the park near our house, or especially when we were flying kites from the roof. <br>Every afternoon in the spring and autumn, when the weather brought a gentle breeze, hundreds of kites would fill the sky above Kabul and stay there until dark. Kite flying was more than a game; it was a matter of the greatest personal pride to cut the string of your rival&#x2019;s kite. The trick was to draw your kite string against your opponent&#x2019;s with speed and force, and slice through his string. <br>Wakeel was the kite master, the kite-flying teacher to us all. The kids on the street had given him the title of &#x201c;Wakeel, the Cruel Cutter,&#x201d; because he had cut so many of their kites. <br>One afternoon, Wakeel looked at me as we were heading to the roof with our kites and said, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have a fight!&#x201d; As usual, his long, dark hair fell over his forehead, brushing his thick eyebrows. And below them were his deep-set, dark eyes that sparkled, always. <br>I said okay, though I knew he would cut me right away. But from the earliest age we are taught never to run away from a fight, even if we think we cannot win. <br>The roof of Grandfather&#x2019;s apartment block was ideal for kite flying. Rising high above the trees that grew along the street, it was like a stage. People below&#x2014;adults as well as kids&#x2014;would see the kites going into the air, and stop everything that they were doing to watch the outcome. A good fight would be talked about for days after. <br>After we had had our kites in the air for half an hour, taunting and feinting, Wakeel called from the far end of the roof in amazement, &#x201c;You have learned a lot! It used to take me only five minutes to cut you. Now it has been more than half an hour, and you are still in the sky.&#x201d; <br>Suddenly, he used a trick that he had not yet shown me. He let his kite loop around mine as if he were trying to choke it. I felt the string in my hand go slack, and there was my kite, flat on its back, wafting back and forth like a leaf in autumn, drifting off across the sky away from me. <br>Wakeel laughed and made a big show of letting his kite fly higher so everybody in the street could see he had yet again been the victor. I ran downstairs to get another kite. <br>Berar, a Hazara teenager who worked with our gardener, loved kite fighting. All the time I had been battling Wakeel, he had been carefully following every dive, envious. <br>Berar was a few years older than Wakeel, tall, handsome, and hardworking. His family lived in Bamyan, where the big statues of Buddha were carved into the mountains. Berar was not his real name. Berar in Hazaragi dialect means &#x201c;brother.&#x201d; We did not know what his real name was, and he did not mind us calling him Berar. <br>As the suspense had built between Wakeel and me, Berar could not stop watching us. The old gardener spoke to him impatiently several times: &#x201c;The weeds are in the ground, not in the sky. Look down.&#x201d; The gardener was always harsh to Berar. <br>&#x201c;Give the boy a break,&#x201d; Grandfather told the gardener. They were working together on Grandfather&#x2019;s beloved rosebushes. I had just sent a second kite into the air. Grandfather nodded at Berar. &#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; he said. <br>Berar ran up to the rooftop, where I was struggling to gain altitude while avoiding Wakeel&#x2019;s torpedoing attacks. Berar took the string from me and told me to hold the reel. <br>I had never seen Berar fly a kite before. I kept shouting at him, &#x201c; <i>Kashko! Kashko!</i> Pull it in!&#x201d; But Berar did not need my instructions; he knew exactly what to do. Wakeel shouted at me that I could have a hundred helpers and he would still cut me. Though he was tall and skinny, he was very strong and he was furiously pulling in his kite to circle it around mine. <br>Berar was getting our kite very high very fast, until in no time at all it was higher than Wakeel&#x2019;s. Then he made it dive so quickly that it dropped like a stone through the air. Suddenly, there was Wakeel&#x2019;s kite, drifting back and forth from left to right, floating off to Kandahar, separated from the now limp string in Wakeel&#x2019;s hand. <br>I climbed on Berar&#x2019;s shoulders, screaming for joy. I had the string of my kite in my hands. My kite was so high in the sky, it looked like a tiny bird.

Eloquently...</p><p>From primordial nothingness to this very moment, <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i> reports what happened and how humans figured it out. To accomplish this daunting literary task, Bill Bryson uses hundreds of sources, from popular science books to interviews with luminaries in various fields. His aim is to help people like him, who rejected stale school textbooks and dry explanations, to appreciate how we have used science to understand the smallest particles and the unimaginably vast expanses of space. With his distinctive prose style and wit, Bryson succeeds admirably. Though <i>A Short History</i> clocks in at a daunting 500-plus pages and covers the same material as every science book before it, it reads something like a particularly detailed novel (albeit without a plot). Each longish chapter is devoted to a topic like the age of our planet or how cells work, and these chapters are grouped into larger sections such as "The Size of the Earth" and "Life Itself." Bryson chats with experts like Richard Fortey (author of <i>Life</i> and <i>Trilobite</i>) and these interviews are charming. But it's when Bryson dives into some of science's best and most embarrassing fights--Cope vs. Marsh, Conway Morris vs. Gould--that he finds literary gold. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>One of the world's most beloved and bestselling writers takes his ultimate journey -- into the most intriguing and intractable questions that science seeks to answer. <br>In A Walk in the Woods, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail -- well, most of it. In In A Sunburned Country, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand -- and, if possible, answer -- the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world's most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything" is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>At home in Thrush Green</h2><p>Charles Henstock, vicar of Thrush Green is living in his new vicarage after the old one burned down.

He is professor emeritus of medical law at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and has served on many national and international bodies concerned with bioethics.</p><p><b>THE NEXT DAY </b>was a working day for Isabel. As editor&#x2014;and now owner&#x2014;of the <i>Review of Applied Ethics, </i>she could determine her own working patterns, but only to an extent. The journal was quarterly, which might have led outsiders to think that Isabel&#x2019;s job could hardly be onerous. Such outsiders would be wrong&#x2014;as outsiders usually are about most things. Although three months intervened between the appearance of each issue of the journal, those three months were regulated by a series of chores that were as regular as the tides, and as unforgiving. Papers had to be sent out for review and, if accepted for publication, edited. The professors of philosophy who wrote these papers were, as Isabel had discovered, only human; they made mistakes in their grammar&#x2014;egregious mis�takes in some cases even if in others only minor solecisms. She corrected most of these, trying not to seem too pedantic in the process. She allowed the collective plural: <i>If you wish to reform a person, you should tell them</i>&#x2014;Isabel allowed the <i>them </i>because there were those who objected strongly to gendered pronouns. So you could not tell <i>him </i>in such circumstances, but would have to tell <i>him or her, </i>which became ungainly and awkward, and sounded like the punctilious language of the legal draughtsman. She also allowed infinitives to be split, which they were with great regularity, because that rule was now almost universally ignored and its authority, anyway, was questionable. Who established that precept, anyway? Why not split an infinitive if one wanted to? The sense was as easily understood whether or not the infinitive was sundered apart or left inviolate. <br>&nbsp;<br>But it was not just the editing of papers that took up her time. An important part of each issue was the review section, where four or five recent books in the field of ethics were reviewed at some length, and a few others, less favoured, were given brief notices. Then there was a short column headed Books Received, which listed other books that had been sent by publishers and were not going to be given a review. It was an ignominious fate for a book, but it was better than nothing. At least the journal acknowledged the fact that the book had been published, which was perhaps as much as some authors could hope for. Some books, even less favoured, got not even that; they fell leaden from the presses, unread, unremarked upon by anyone. Yet somewhere, behind those unreadable tomes, there was an author, the proud parent of that particular book, for whom it might even be the crowning achievement of a career; and all that happened on publication was silence, a profound and unfathomable silence. <br>&nbsp;<br>That morning, four large padded envelopes were sitting on Isabel&#x2019;s desk in her large Victorian house in Merchiston. She closed the study door behind her, and looked at her desk. The four packages were clearly books&#x2014;they had that look to them&#x2014; and several other envelopes which her housekeeper, Grace, had retrieved from the floor of the hall were just as evidently papers submitted for publication. It would take her until lunchtime to deal with these, she decided; Jamie had a free morning&#x2014; no bassoon pupils and no rehearsals&#x2014;which meant that he could devote his time to his son. They were going to Blackford Pond, where the ducks were a source of infinite fascination to Charlie. Then they would go somewhere else, he said, but he had yet to decide where. &#x201c;Charlie will have views,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll tell me.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Charlie now spoke quite well, in primitive sentences with a subject&#x2014;as often as not himself&#x2014;and a verb, usually in the present tense but occasionally in the past. His past tense, Isabel had noticed, had a special ring to it. &#x201c;It is a special past tense he uses,&#x201d; she said to Jamie. &#x201c;It is the <i>past regretful. </i>The past regretful is used to express regret over what has happened. <i>All gone </i>is a past regretful, as is <i>Ducks eaten all bread.</i>&#x201d; He still talked about olives, of course; <i>olive </i>had been his first word, and his appetite for olives was as strong as ever. <i>Olives nice, </i>he had said to Isabel the previous day, and she, too, thought that they were nice. They had then looked at one another, Charlie staring at his mother with the intense gaze of childhood. She had waited for him to say something more, but he had not. They had said everything there was to say about olives, it seemed, and so she bent forward and kissed him lightly on his forehead. <br>&nbsp;<br>She thought of that now as she surveyed her desk. She sighed; she was a mother, but she was also an editor, and a philosopher, and she had to work. Settling herself at her desk, she opened the first of the book parcels. Two books tumbled out, accompanied by a compliments slip on which a careless hand had scribbled <i>For favour of a review. </i>Underneath was the date of publication and a request that no review should appear before then. That, thought Isabel, was easily enough complied with, given that journal reviews were sometimes published as much as two years after publication. She herself had reviewed a book eighteen months after publication and had only discovered after her review had been published that the author had died six months previously. It was not a good book, and in her review she had written that she felt that the author&#x2019;s next book on the subject would be much better. Worse than that, she had com�mented on a certain lifelessness in the prose. Well, he was dead; perhaps he was dying when he wrote the book. She shuddered at the memory. She had tried to be charitable, but she had not been charitable enough. Remember that, she said to herself; remember that in your dealings with others&#x2014;they may be dying. <br>&nbsp;<br>The two books looked interesting enough. One was on the moral implications of being a twin; the second was on the notion of fairness in economic judgements. She was not greatly excited by the economics book&#x2014;that would be <i>received, </i>she thought . . . unless the author was dying, of course. She turned to the back flap and looked at the photograph of the author. He looked young, she decided, and healthy enough to write another book, which might get a full review. He could be placed in the <i>received </i>pile without risk of . . . she was about to say <i>injus�tice </i>to herself, when she realised she was being unjust. Just because she was not particularly interested in discussions of fairness in economics, that did not mean that others would not be. No, she would promote the book to the Brief Notice section. That was fair. As for the twins book, on opening it, she saw this sentence: &#x201c;Because moral obligation comes with close�ness, there is a case for saying that the twin owes a greater duty to his or her twin than is owed by non-twins to their siblings.&#x201d; She frowned. Why? She flicked through several pages and read, at random, &#x201c;Of the many dilemmas confronting the twin, a par�ticularly demanding one is the decision whether or not to tell one&#x2019;s twin of a medical diagnosis received. If one twin is diag�nosed with a genetic disease, for example a form of cancer in which there is a strong familial element, then the other twin should know.&#x201d; That, said Isabel to herself, is not a dilemma. You tell. <br>&nbsp;<br>The twins book would have to be reviewed, and it occurred to Isabel that it would be interesting to have it reviewed by somebody who was a twin. But the twin would have to be a philosopher, and she was not sure if she knew any person answering that description. The author, perhaps, might know; she would write to him and ask him. Of course she could not commit herself to any name that he suggested&#x2014;authors could not choose their reviewers&#x2014;but it would be a start. <br>&nbsp;<br>She opened the next parcel and extracted from it a slender book bound in blue. Tucked into it was a folded letter, which she took out and opened. She saw the heading of the notepaper first and caught her breath. Then she read it. <br>&nbsp;<br>The letter came from Professor Lettuce, the previous chair�man of the <i>Review</i>&#x2019;s editorial board and friend and collaborator of Professor Christopher Dove, the closest thing to an enemy that Isabel was aware of possessing. She had not chosen Dove as an enemy&#x2014;he had assumed that role himself, and had revealed a ruthless streak in the process. He had recently accused Isabel of publishing a plagiarised article, but had been seen off. Lettuce had initially backed him, but had been per�suaded by Isabel to change his ways&#x2014;&#x201c;I have been a foolish Lettuce&#x201d; was his memorable remark on that occasion. Now it appeared that Dove and Lettuce were friends again, because here was Lettuce sending Isabel a new book by Dove and offer�ing to review it. <br><br>Dear Isabel [wrote Lettuce], <br><br>I hope that this finds you well and that the <i>Review </i>is thriving in your capable hands. Our mutual friend [<i>our mutual friend, </i>Isabel muttered <i>sotto voce</i>] Chris Dove <i>[Chris!] </i>has, as you may know, written a rather interest�ing new book. I&#x2019;m not sure if the publishers have sent you a copy&#x2014;perhaps they have&#x2014;but at the risk of bur�dening you with numerous copies, here is another one. I thought I might offer to review it for you, and have started penning a few thoughts, if that&#x2019;s all right with you. I&#x2019;ll do about two thousand words because I think that this is a work that deserves a decent discussion. I&#x2019;m a bit pressed at the moment&#x2014;this wretched research assessment business is such a burden&#x2014;and Dolly [<i>Dolly Lettuce, his wife, </i>thought Isabel. <i>Poor woman. Dolly!</i>] is in the middle of making redecoration plans for our house at Wimbledon, so all is rather fraught on the domestic front&#x2014;but I should be able to get it done by the end of the month and will send it along then. <br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks so much for agreeing to this, and please&#x2014;<i>please</i>&#x2014;do get in touch with me when you wrench yourself away from the provinces and come to London. <br>&nbsp;<br>Lunch will be on me. <br>&nbsp;<br>All best, <br>&nbsp;<br>Robert Lettuce <br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel felt the discomfort of being outraged but not being sure of which cause of her outrage was the more significant. Lettuce had casually insulted Scotland&#x2014;which was <i>not </i>a province of England, but a country&#x2014;and an old one at that&#x2014; within a union with England. Nothing could be more calculated to annoy a Scotswoman, and Lettuce should have known that. But that was merely a matter of personal pride, which Isabel could swallow easily enough; it was more difficult for her to deal with the breathtaking arrogance of his assumption that he could write a review without being asked. He thanked her for agreeing to publish his review&#x2014;well, she had not agreed and felt highly inclined not to do so, and she would not be bought off with a breezy invitation to lunch in London. <br>&nbsp;<br>She would write to Lettuce, she decided, and thank him for offering to review Dove&#x2019;s book, but would say that she must&#x2014; very reluctantly&#x2014;decline his offer because . . . She thought of reasons. It would be tempting to say that it was because Dove&#x2019;s book was not of sufficient interest to merit a review&#x2014;that was <i>very </i>tempting. Or she might say that she had decided to review the book herself. That was perhaps even more tempting, because it would give her the chance to cast Dove&#x2019;s book into the outer darkness that it undoubtedly deserved. &#x201c;This slight contribution to the literature,&#x201d; she might write, &#x201c;is unlikely to find many readers.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;An effort to elucidate a difficult topic&#x2014; courageous, yes, but unfortunately a failure.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>She stopped herself. Such thoughts, she told herself, were crude fantasies of revenge. Dove had plotted against her and would have succeeded in hounding her out of her job had she not had the resources to buy the <i>Review </i>from under his nose, and then get rid not only of him but also of Lettuce, who had been his co-conspirator. Dove had planned her removal, but that did not mean that she should stoop to his level and seek revenge by writing a critical review of his book. That would be quite wrong. <br>&nbsp;<br>She looked up at the ceiling. One of the drawbacks to being a philosopher was that you became aware of what you should not do, and this took from you so many opportunities to savour the human pleasure of revenge or greed or sheer fantasising. Well might St. Augustine have said <i>Make me chaste, but not just yet; </i>that was how Isabel felt. And yet she could not; she could not let herself experience the pleasure of getting her own back on Dove because it was, quite simply, always wrong to get one&#x2019;s own back on another. It was her duty to <i>forgive </i>Dove and, if one were to be really serious about it, to go further than that and to <i>love </i>him. Hate the acts of Doves, not Doves themselves, she muttered; they said that about sin, did they not? Hate the sin, not the sinner. <br>&nbsp;<br>She put aside Lettuce&#x2019;s letter and picked up Dove&#x2019;s book. She read the title, <i>Freedom and Choice: The Limits of Responsi�bility in a Role-Fixated World. </i>She wrinkled her nose. Was the world really role-fixated? Freedom of choice, though, was a sub�ject in which she was interested, and indeed she had written on the subject when she was still a graduate research fellow. Turn�ing to the end of the book, she found an annotated bibliography. She could see that Dove had been assiduous in his marshalling of the literature, and there, yes, there were her two papers on this subject. And after the first of these&#x2014;a paper that had been published in the <i>Journal of Philosophy, </i>and which had been fairly widely cited&#x2014;was Dove&#x2019;s annotation. He had used only one word: <i>Unreliable.&nbsp;</i><br>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Star Wars: Vader Down</h2><p>Two of the biggest titles in comics collide in the first crossover of the new Marvel age of Star Wars!

He died in 2014.<b><i>Chapter 1<br></i></b><br>One May morning my friend Bruce and I went for a hike on the prairie.<br><br>Spring was late that year in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Snowdrifts still clung along the steep banks of the river in the shelter of the cottonwood trees. The river was icy with thaw water and, as we crossed over the Railroad Bridge, we could feel a cold breath rising from it. But we felt another breath, a gentle one, blowing across the distant wheat fields and smelling like warm sun shining on soft mud. It was the spring wind, and the smell of it made us walk faster. We were in a hurry to get out of the city and into the real prairie, where you can climb a fence post and see for about a million miles &#x2013; that&#x2019;s how flat the prairie is.<br><br>The great thing about Saskatoon was the way it ended sharp all around its edge. There were no outskirts to Saskatoon. When you stepped off the end of the Railroad Bridge you stepped right onto the prairie and there you were &#x2013; free as the gophers.<br><br>Gophers were the commonest thing on the prairie. The little mounds of yellow dirt around their burrows were so thick, sometimes, it looked as if the fields had yellow measles.<br><br>But this day Bruce and I weren&#x2019;t interested in gophers. We were looking for an owl&#x2019;s-nest. We had decided that we wanted some pet owls, and if you want pet owls you have to find a nest and get the young ones out of it.<br><br>We headed for the nearest of the clumps of cottonwood trees that dot the prairies, and which are called &#x201c;bluffs&#x201d; out in Saskatchewan. The ground was spongy under our sneakers, and it squooshed when we hit a wet place. A big jack rabbit bounced up right under my feet, and scared me so much I jumped almost as high as he did. And as we came nearer the bluff, two crows came zooming out of it and swooped down on us, cawing their heads off.<br><br>Bluffs are funny places in the spring. The cottonwood trees shed a kind of white fluffy stuff that looks like snow. Sometimes it&#x2019;s so thick it comes right over the top of your sneakers and you get a queer feeling that you really <i>are</i> walking through snow, even though the sun on your back is making you sweat right through your shirt.<br><br>We walked through this bluff, scuffing our feet in the cottonwood snow and stirring it up in clouds. We kept looking up; and after a while, sure enough, we saw a big mess of twigs high up in a poplar.<br><br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Bruce said to the two crows which were swooping and hollering at us. &#x201c;If you want me to snitch your eggs &#x2013; I will!&#x201d;<br><br>With that he handed me his haversack and began to shinny up the tree.<br><br>It was an easy climb because cottonwood poplars always have lots of branches. When he got to the nest and looked into it I yelled up at him: &#x201c;Any eggs?&#x201d; Bruce grinned but he wouldn&#x2019;t answer. I could see him doing something with his free hand &#x2013; the one he wasn&#x2019;t holding on with &#x2013; and I knew there were eggs there all right. I watched, and sure enough he was popping them into his mouth so he could carry them down out of the tree.<br><br>We always carried eggs down out of trees that way. The only thing was, crows&#x2019; eggs are pretty big, and if you have to stuff three or four of them into your mouth it nearly chokes you.<br><br>Bruce started to climb down. When he got about ten feet from the ground he stepped on a rotten branch. Poplar branches are always rotten near the ground, and you have to watch out for them. I guess Bruce forgot. Anyway, the branch broke and he slid the rest of the way and lit on his seat with a good hard bump.<br><br>All the eggs had broken, and Bruce was spitting out shells and eggs all over the cottonwood snow. I got laughing so hard I couldn&#x2019;t even talk. When Bruce got most of the eggs spat out he came for me and tackled me, and we had a fight. It didn&#x2019;t last long, because it was too hot to really fight, so Bruce ate a sardine sandwich to get the taste of crows&#x2019; eggs out of his mouth and then we started across the prairie again to search through other bluffs until we found an owl&#x2019;s-nest.<br><br>I guess we searched about a hundred bluffs that morning, but we never saw an owl. We were getting hungry by then, so we made a sort of nest for ourselves on the ground, out of poplar snow and branches. We curled up in it and opened our haversacks.<br><br>Bruce had sandwiches and a lemon in his. He was the only boy I ever knew who liked to eat lemons. He said they were better than oranges, any day of the week.<br><br>I had a hard-boiled egg and just for fun I reached over and cracked the shell on Bruce&#x2019;s head. He yelled, and we had another fight, and rolled all over his sardine sandwiches.<br><br>We were just finishing our lunch when a wood gopher came snuffling along through the cottonwood snow. Wood gophers are gray and have big bushy tails. This one came right up to us and, when I held a crust out to him, he shuffled up and took it out of my hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Got no sense,&#x201d; said Bruce. &#x201c;You might have been a coyote, and then where&#x2019;d he be at?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Heck,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got more sense than you. Do I look like a coyote?&#x201d;<br><br>The gopher didn&#x2019;t say anything. He just took the crust and scuttled away to his hole somewhere. We picked up our haversacks. The sun was as bright as fireworks and the sky was so clear you could look right through it &#x2013; like looking through a blue window. We started to walk.<br><br>All of a sudden Bruce stopped so fast that I bumped into him.<br><br>&#x201c;Lookee!&#x201d; he said, and pointed to a bluff about half a mile away. There must have been a million crows around it. It looked as if the bluff was on fire and filling the sky with black smoke &#x2013; that&#x2019;s how many crows there were.<br><br>When you see a bunch of crows all yelling their heads off at something, you can almost bet it&#x2019;s an owl they&#x2019;re after. Crows and owls hate each other, and when a crow spots an owl, he&#x2019;ll call every other crow for miles and they all join in and mob the owl.<br><br>We headed for that bluff at a run. The crows saw us coming but they were too excited to pay much attention. We were nearly deaf with their racket by the time we reached the edge of the trees. I was ahead of Bruce when I saw something big and slow go drifting out of one poplar into another. It was a great horned owl, the biggest kind of owl there is, and as soon as it flew, the whole lot of crows came swooping down on it, cawing like fury. I noticed they were careful not to get too close.<br><br>Bruce and I started to hunt for the nest. After a while, the owl got more worried about us than about the crows and away he went. He flew low over the fields, almost touching the ground. That way the crows couldn&#x2019;t dive on him. If they tried it they would shoot past him and crash into the dirt.<br><br>There wasn&#x2019;t any owl&#x2019;s-nest in that bluff after all, but we didn&#x2019;t worry. We knew the nest would have to be in some bluff not too far away. All we had to do was look.<br><br>We looked in different bluffs all afternoon. We found seven crows&#x2019;-nests, a red-tailed hawk&#x2019;s-nest, and three magpies&#x2019;-nests. I tore the seat out of my trousers climbing to the hawk&#x2019;s-nest, and we both got Russian thistles in our sneakers, so we had sore feet. It got hotter and hotter, and we were so thirsty I could have eaten a lemon myself, except that Bruce didn&#x2019;t have any more.<br><br>It was past suppertime when we started back toward the railroad. By then we were pretending we were a couple of Arabs lost in the desert. Our camels had died of thirst, and we were going to die too unless we found some water pretty soon.<br><br>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; Bruce said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s an old well at Haultain Corner. If we cut over past Barney&#x2019;s Slough to the section road, we can get a drink.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Too late,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Good-by, old pal, old Sheik. I am doomed. Go on and leave me lay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, nuts,&#x201d; said Bruce. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thirsty. C&#x2019;mon, let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br><br>So we cut past Barney&#x2019;s Slough and there were about a thousand mallard ducks on it. They all jumped into the air as we went by and their wings made a sound like a freight train going over a bridge.<br><br>&#x201c;Wish I had my dad&#x2019;s gun!&#x201d; said Bruce.<br><br>But I was wondering why on the prairies they call lakes and ponds &#x201c;sloughs.&#x201d; I still don&#x2019;t know why. But that&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;re called in Saskatoon.<br>&nbsp;<br><br>There was one big bluff between us and Haultain Corner. It was too far to go around it, so we walked right through it. Anyway, it was cooler in among the trees. When we were about halfway through I spotted a crow&#x2019;s-nest in a big old cottonwood.<br><br>&#x201c;Bet it&#x2019;s empty,&#x201d; I said to Bruce. But the truth was that I was just too hot and tired to climb any more trees. Bruce felt the same way, and we walked past. But I took one last look up at it, and there, sticking over the edge of the nest, was the biggest bunch of tail feathers you ever saw. My heart jumped right into my throat and I grabbed Bruce by the shirt and pointed up.<br><br>It was a great horned owl all right. We kept as quiet as we could, so as not to scare her, and then we looked around the bottom of the tree. There were bits of rabbits and gophers, and lots of owl pellets. When owls catch something, they eat the whole thing&#x2013;bones and fur and all. Then, after a while, they burp and spit out a ball of hair and bones. That&#x2019;s an owl pellet.<br><br>&#x201c;By Gang! We found it!&#x201d; Bruce whispered.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>I</i> found it,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; said Bruce. &#x201c;<i>You</i> found it, then. So how about you climbing up and seeing how many young ones are in it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing doing, old pal,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;<i>I</i> found the nest. So if <i>you</i> want one of the owlets, <i>you</i> climb up and have a look.&#x201d;<br><br>Neither of us was keen to climb that tree. The old owl was sticking close to her nest, and you can&#x2019;t always tell how fierce an owl is going to be. They can be pretty fierce sometimes.<br><br>&#x201c;Say,&#x201d; said Bruce after a while, &#x201c;why don&#x2019;t we just leave her be for now? Might scare her into leaving the nest for good if <i>we</i> climbed up. What say we get Mr. Miller, and come back tomorrow?&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Miller was one of our teachers. Bruce and I liked him because he liked the prairie too. He was a great one for taking pictures of birds and things. We knew he would be crazy to get some pictures of the owl &#x2013; and Mr. Miller never minded climbing trees.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Good idea.&#x201d;<br><br>We went off to Haultain Corner and got a drink of water that tasted like old nails, out of the broken pump. Then we walked on home. That night I told Dad about the owl&#x2019;s-nest, and he looked at Mother, and all he said was:<br><br>&#x201c;Oh NO! Not owls too.&#x201d;</p><h2>No More Dying Then</h2><p>What kind of a person would kidnap two children?That is the question that haunts Wexford when a five-year-old boy and a twelve-year-old girl disappear from the village of Kingsmarkham.

Take Ladybug from the cover pocket, set her on the winding word path, and explore the garden with her as she slides through the slots in each picture.<br></p><p>No BioThis cleverly engineered, invitingly illustrated volume takes the idea of a story line literally, striking an ideal balance between the abstract and the concrete aspects of reading. Its heroine, a ladybug in search of a resting place, is reproduced on a separate, diecut bit of sturdy cardstock, so that when the text and pictures indicate new segments of the ladybug's journey (from under a stone and into a flower pot; across the garden shed and toward a purring cat, etc.), the reader can simulate the action. The type is set in curving lines, tracing the character's flight on each page and steering the reader toward a diecut opening through which the cardstock ladybug enters the next spread.

He will tell you, 'There is as much need to watch over grace, as to watch over sin.' He will show you God in Christ, to fill up the place usurped by self. The subtleties of sin, idols, snares, temptations, self-deceptions, are dragged into view from time to time. And what is better still, the cords of Christ are twined round the roots of these bitter plants, that they may be plucked up. <br> Nor is it otherwise in regard to corruption in public, and in the Church. We do not mean merely the open corruption of error, but also the secret 'gray hairs' of decay. Hear him cry, 'There is universal deadness on that fear of God. O where are the sometime quickening breathings and influences from heaven that have refreshed His hidden ones!' And then he laments, in the name of the saints, 'We are half satisfied with out witherdness; nor have we as much of his strain who doth eight times breathe out that suit, Quicken me!' 'We live far from the well, and complain but dryly of our dryness.' - <strong><i>Andrew Bonar</i></strong></p><p>Samuel Rutherford (1600 1661) was a Scottish minister and covenanter best known for his political book, "Lex Rex; or, The Law and the Prince", for which he was charged with high treason and imprisoned. The book argued for limited government, as well as limitations on the current idea of the divine right of kings.<br><br>Andrew Bonar (1810-1892) was a minister of the Free Church of Scotland in Glasgow and was the younger brother of the noted hymn writer Horatius Bonar. He was also the author of a famous biography of Robert Murray McCheyne.'When we are dead and gone let the world know that <strong>Spurgeon</strong> held <strong>Rutherford's</strong> letters to be the nearest thing to inspiration which can be found in all the writings of mere men.' --<strong><i>Charles Spurgeon</i></strong><br><br>'Surprising though it may seem in a world of large books, of all those owned by our family this may be the one we have most often lent or quoted to friends.' --<strong><i>Sinclair B. Ferguson</i></strong><br><br>'Apart form the Bible, "such a book as Mr. <strong>Rutherford's</strong> Letters the world never saw the like."' --<strong><i>Richard Baxter</i></strong></p><h2>Ambush Valley: I Corps Vietnam, 1967-The Story of a Marine Infantry Battalion&#39;s Battle for Survival</h2><p>Relates the experiences of one Marine infantry battalion during the Vietnam War</p><p>The Third Battalion, 26th Marines, set out on September 7, 1967, to scout an area near a beleaguered fire base in northern I Corps and were attacked by over twice their number of troops from the disciplined and well-armed People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN). On the 10th, while moving into a new area, they encountered the same unit again, and the PAVN made a concerted attempt to wipe them out. This harrowing action is told almost entirely in the words of the survivors in a style that resembles the script for a documentary. By switching back and forth between voices Hammel is able to reinforce or expand on moments in the action; the device elevates this oral history of small unit action over most of its kind. The voices reflect bravery, loss, the sense of having overcome impossible obstacles; a solid entry in writings on the Vietnam War by an experienced military historian.<br><i>- Mel D. Lane, Sacramento, Cal.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.When the 3rd Battalion of the 26th Marines moved into position near the DMZ in September '67 they didn't know that an entire North Vietnamese regiment lay close by. Hammel ( Khe Sanh ) here relates what happened in an integrated series of statements by the surviving Americans. In two battles the Marine battalion lost 40% of its combat strength and barely escaped annihilaton. For the Americans the September 7 and 10 contacts exemplified Murphy's Law in action: 3/26 was bombarded by its own artillery, became the target of its own planes, received a minimum of resupply while running low on ammunition, and was subjected to relentless assaults by the 812th NVA Regiment. The desperate defensive tactics as well as the raw emotions of the men are vividly conveyed in this memorable mosaic of concentrated warfare.

When the Jewish people accepted God&#39;s covenant, they committed themselves first to obedience and practice, and then to striving to understand the message implicit in the Torah. In Understanding Judaism: The Basics of Deed and Creed, a perfect textbook for independent and classroom study, Rabbi Benjamin Blech presents a comprehensive explication of the Jewish faith. What does it meant to be a Jew? How does religion affect the ways in which Jewish people think and act? What are the basic concepts of Judaism? This volume answers these vital questions.</p><p><b>Rabbi Benjamin Blech</b> holds a masters degree in psychology from Columbia University, and has written nine books on Judaism, including three as part of the highly popular Idiot's Guide series (one of which was cited by Larry King as "a piece of art"). He has taught at Yeshiva University since 1966, and has received the American Educator of the Year award. A tenth-generation rabbi, Blech is a frequent lecturer in Jewish communities around the world. He has appeared on national television (including The Oprah Winfrey Show), and writes regularly for major newspapers and journals. He was recently ranked #16 in a listing of the 50 most influential Jews in America. Born in Zurich, Rabbi Blech lives in Manhattan with his wife Elaine.Rabbi Blech's book is one that every Jew should read. Even Jews who are very knowledgeable with regard to their ancestral faith will find in it new insights that deal with aspects of the tradition of which one might have thought that nothing new could besaid. Only a rabbi who is at one and the same time an inspiring spiritual leader of an active congregation of committed Jews, and a master teacher of college students searching for their spiritual roots, could so skillfully combine in his presentation ofJudaism so much that can open the eyes of the latter and deepen the delight of the learned in that which they fathomed only superficially...

In this sequel to his 2009 novel, <i>Rain Gods</i>, Burke returns to the hard-scrabble Texas town on the Mexican border, and its contemplative sheriff Hackberry Holland. Holland is a quintessential Burke hero&#x2014;deeply moral, tortured by past sins, appalled at the depravity of our fallen world, and firmly committed to justice. <i>Feast Day of Fools</i> opens with a horrific murder in the desert. One man is tortured and dismembered by a menacing psychopath named Krill. Another man, a government agent whom Krill kidnapped and planned to sell to Al Qaeda, escapes into the night. In its aftermath, Holland encounters a vibrant cast of characters&#x2014;including Anton Ling, an enigmatic woman whose home is a place of refuge to desperate immigrants, and the riveting Preacher Jack Collins, a terrifying serial killer, who had seemingly died at the end of <i>Rain Gods</i>. Packed with lush imagery and allegorical heft, <i>Feast Day of Fools</i> is a tightly wound thriller that reconfirms James Lee Burke&#x2019;s status as a master storyteller.--Shane Hansanuwat <br><br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Michael Connelly Reviews <em>Feast Day of Fools</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong>Michael Connelly is a former journalist and best-selling author of <em>The Scarecrow</em>, <em>The Fifth Witness</em>, <em>The Brass Verdict</em>, and <em>The Lincoln Lawyer</em></strong>. <br> <p> </p> <p>You know what is rare? A veteran and prodigious writer who never lets you down. Who, with each book, and I&#x2019;m talking about a lot of books, makes you feel like you have discovered something new, learned some hidden truth about human behavior and society. James Lee Burke is one of those rarities. Book to book he keeps it going, never disappointing. Last year's masterpiece is just prelude to this year's new masterpiece. </p> <p>It flat out astounds me. I can count the names of other writers in this category on one hand. There is no magic formula for this. It's something that comes from within, an indeterminate mixture of craft and wisdom and the relentless pursuit of perfection. It comes from knowing deep in the bones that life is about reconciliation and redemption. Burke's books carry these truths in spades.</p> <p>About twenty-five years ago I picked up a book called <em>The Neon Rain</em> in a bookstore simply because I liked the cover. I read the flaps and read the first page and went to the cash register. Soon I was into my first ride with James Lee Burke. </p> <p><em>The Neon Rain</em> was that year's masterpiece. This year, we have <em>Feast Day of Fools</em> and my survey of Burke books in between concludes that he remains the heavy weight champ, a great American novelist whose work, taken individually or as a whole, is unsurpassed.</p> <p>It is the writer's job to look out the window at the world and tell us how he sees it. In this book Burke puts the unblinking eye on the issues of politics and immigration and religion, synthesizing it all down to the character and impulse of violence and vengeance. At center, he gives us Hackberry Holland, a man who carries the past with him like the Texas sheriff's badge pinned to his chest. He gives us villains as treacherous as any ever put down on page. And he gives us prose as deeply etched and poetic as the landscape along the Texas-Mexico border. Here&#x2019;s just one little taste that I loved: "Hackberry realized that he was about to witness one of those moments when evil reveals itself for what it is-&#x2013;insane in its fury and self-hatred and its animus at whatever reminds it of itself."</p> <p>This is a story about the evil that men do. It is allegory. It is knowledge. As one of the characters says to the man who has witnessed his cruelty, "Maybe one day you will understand men like us."</p> <p>I think James Lee Burke does and this year's masterpiece takes us closer to the heart of the matter. It makes us look through the window and see the world in a new way. <em>--Michael Connelly</em></p>James Lee Burke is a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author, two-time winner of the Edgar Award, and the recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts in Fiction.

His mother, Alice, for her part, struggles with her own demons as she attempts to realize her dreams of prosperity and success as a sculptor. As Robert goes off to fight in Europe, hoping to become his own man, Richard Yates portrays a soldier in the depths of war striving to live up to his heroic ideals. With haunting clarity, Yates crafts an unforgettable portrait of two people who cannot help but hope for more even as life challenges them both.</p><p>Richard Yates was born in 1926. The author of several acclaimed works of fiction, including <b>Revolutionary Road</b>, <b>Eleven Kinds of Loneliness</b>, <b>Disturbing the Peace</b>, and <b>The Easter Parade</b>, he was lauded during his lifetime as the foremost novelist of the post-war "age of anxiety". He died in 1992.Chapter One&#34;Com-mence--fire!&#34;The blast of rifles shocked his ears, right and left; he squeezed the trigger and felt the stock of his own rifle drive hard into his shoulder and cheek, and then he fired again.They were lying prone on a damp Virginia ridge, firing down across a dismal slope of weeds at a simulated enemy position several hundred yards away--a group of crude wooden house fronts flanked by clumps of trees. Gray silhouette targets darted in and out of view at the windows and came irregularly up from foxholes among the trees, and at first Prentice didn&#39;t aim at them very precisely: the main thing seemed to be to keep firing, to get off as many rounds as the men on either side of him. But after a few seconds the tension eased off and he became both careful and fast. It was exhilarating.&#34;Cease fire! Cease fire! All right, fall back. Everybody back. Second squad, let&#39;s go. Second squad up on the line.&#34;Prentice locked his rifle, got up, and stumbled back down the ridge with the others to where a small, painstakingly built campfire was struggling for survival. He made his way into the huddle of men surrounding it and found a place to stand beside John Quint.&#34;Think you hit anything, Deadeye?&#34; Quint asked him.&#34;A couple, I think. I&#39;m pretty sure I got a couple, anyway. You?&#34;&#34;Hell, I don&#39;t know.&#34;It was the last afternoon of the week&#39;s bivouac that was the climax of their training. Any day now they would be shipped out for overseas processing, and the company&#39;s morale could not have been lower, but Prentice had begun to feel an unreasonable elation. It pleased him to know that he hadn&#39;t bathed or changed his clothes for six days, that he was learning to handle his rifle as an extension of himself, and that he&#39;d taken part in elaborate field problems without doing anything noticeably absurd. A pleasant little spasm of shuddering seized him; he squared his shoulders, set his feet wider apart, and briskly rubbed his hands together in the woodsmoke.&#34;Hey Prentice,&#34; said Novak, who had been watching him from the other side of the fire. &#34;You feeling pretty sharp today? You feeling like a real fighting man?&#34;This caused a chuckle around the group, and Cameron, a big Southerner who was Novak&#39;s friend, did his best to keep it going. &#34;Old Prentice gunna be a regular tiger, ain&#39;t he? Jesus, I&#39;m glad he&#39;s on our side.&#34;He tried to ignore them, continuing to rub his hands and stare down into the weak flames, but the sound of their bored, easy laughter had spoiled his mood.Hardly any of the men in his platoon were less than five years older than Prentice; some were thirty and a few were nearly forty, and a more surly, less amiable crowd he could never have imagined. Like him, they had all come to Camp Pickett from other branches of the service--this whole training regiment, in fact, was what the Army called an Infantry Re-Tread Center--but there was a considerable difference between his case and theirs. He was a veteran of nothing more than six weeks of mild and pampered training as an Air Force recruit, followed by a shapeless month of work details in something called a Casual Company; the others were all old-timers. Some were from recently dissolved Anti-Aircraft units, in which they had idled for years at the gun emplacements around West Coast defense plants; some were from Ordnance or Quartermaster depots; there were ex-cooks and ex-clerks and ex-orderlies, and there were washouts from various officer-candidate schools. Many of them were noncoms in line or technical grades and continued to wear their impotent chevrons, but all of them--every foulmouthed, hard-drinking, complaining one of them--had in common the miserable fact that their good deals, their months or years of military safety were over. They were replacement riflemen.And if Prentice had entertained any notion of being called &#34;Bob&#34; or &#34;Slim&#34; or &#34;Stretch&#34; by these men, of relaxing with them in the easy camaraderie of his Air Force days, it was a hope he&#39;d had to abandon at once. They called him &#34;Kid&#34; or &#34;Junior&#34; or &#34;Prentice&#34; or nothing at all, and their general indifference had soon turned into a contemptuous amusement.On the very first morning, late for Reveille and sleepily fumbling with his unfamiliar infantry leggings, he had put the damned things on backwards, with the hook lacings on the inside rather than the outside of his calves; he had taken four running steps across the barracks floor before the lacing hooks of one legging caught the lace of the other, and down he came--all gangling, flailing six-foot-three of him--in a spectacular lock-legged fall that left his audience weak with laughter for the rest of the day.And thereafter he had gone from bad to worse. He was incurably clumsy at close-order drill; he couldn&#39;t perform the manual of arms without an unsightly dipping of his head when he wrenched open the rifle&#39;s chamber; in the field his spindly, ill-coordinated body was put to tests of reflex and endurance that seemed wholly beyond its powers, and he repeatedly floundered and failed.Worse still, he found himself unable to accept his defeats with any kind of grace. He would rise from each humiliation with a mouthful of shrill obscenities, trying by sheer verbal unpleasantness to beat these laughing bastards at their own game, and the result of this was to lower him still further in their esteem. An all-around incompetent was bad enough, and a wet-behind-the-ears young twerp of an incompetent was worse; but when he turned out to be a little wise guy too--when he swore not only in bad temper but in what sounded like the clipped, snotty accents of a spoiled rich kid--that was too much.And then one morning after bayonet drill, when the company was marched into a stifling clapboard building for its weekly I. and E. lecture, he found a way in which his luck might possibly begin to change. The lecture was as tedious as ever: first a documentary film, thunderously identified on the screen as one of the Why We Fight series, which explained the evils of Nazi Germany in simple-minded words and pictures; then a droning talk by a bored-looking second lieutenant who explained it all over again, and then the question period.A man several seats away from Prentice got up to raise a question--a quiet ex-Ordnance man from Idaho whom he&#39;d sometimes noticed smoking a pipe in the post library, a man named John Quint--and from the moment he began to talk Prentice sat spellbound.&#34;I&#39;d like to take issue, sir, with one or two of the points made in the movie just now. Actually, they&#39;re things I&#39;ve noticed cropping up time and again in the Army&#39;s indoctrination program, and I think we might do well to examine them a little more closely...&#34;It wasn&#39;t what he said that mattered, though all of it was interesting and thoughtful; it was the remarkable ease and confidence of his delivery. Here was a man who couldn&#39;t have been more than twenty-four or five--and a bespectacled, almost prissy-looking man at that, a man whose vocabulary and enunciation clearly marked him as &#34;cultivated&#34;--and without the slightest compromise, without any hint of talking down to them, he was holding the respectful attention of every muscle-headed slob in the room. He even got a few laughs--not by any clumsy descent into G.I. humor, but by urbane and witty turns of phrase that Prentice would have thought to be miles over their heads. Hooking his thumbs in his cartridge belt, courteously turning from one section of his audience to another as his glasses gleamed in the lights, he was using words like &#34;ludicrous&#34; and &#34;corruptible&#34; with the dark sweat of the day&#39;s bayonet drill still staining his back: he was proving that you didn&#39;t have to be a lout to be a soldier.When he finished and sat down, there was a spatter of applause.&#34;Yes,&#34; the lieutenant said. &#34;Thank you. I think that was very well put. Are there any other questions?&#34;That was all, but it was enough to give Prentice a sharp new focus for his yearnings. He knew what he wanted in the Army now. The hell with this childish nonsense of being &#34;liked&#34; or &#34;disliked,&#34; of being &#34;accepted&#34; or not. All he wanted now, beyond a certain basic competence, was to be as intelligent and articulate as Quint, as independent as Quint, as aloof from the Army&#39;s indignities as Quint. He very nearly wanted to be Quint, and at the very least he wanted to get to know him.But the fool of the platoon could hardly buddy up with its one and only intellectual--not, at least, right off the bat. It was a thing that would have to be pursued very cautiously, and with no visible effort at pursuit.It began that very evening, when he strolled over to Quint&#39;s bunk for a desultory chat and was careful to walk away again before there could be any hint of his imposing. Several nights later he saw Quint reading in the library but thought better of going over to start another conversation, though he was careful to display the title of the rather highbrow book he was carrying, in case Quint happened to look up as he passed by on his way to the charge-out desk. Then, luckily, the company began its week of training on the rifle range, marching out there before dawn each morning for a nine-hour session with the targets, and this routine left long conversational openings in the middle of the working day. There were whole half-hours with nothing to do but sit around and wait for your turn on the firing line, and there was even more leisure during the noon meal, which was served in mess kits from a mobile field kitchen. Prentice made the most of those chances; it wasn&#39;t long before he and Quint were pairing off at each break, almost as a matter of course. Then when the company went out on bivouac they pitched their shelter halves together and shared the cramped, wet, two-man discomfort of a pup tent in which they both developed chest colds.By now they had grown as close as members of the same unhappy family, but Prentice knew they couldn&#39;t yet be accurately described as friends, let alone as &#34;buddies.&#34; They didn&#39;t even look right together: Prentice was at least nine inches too tall, with a small, large-eyed face still nakedly eager for approval; Quint was solid and settled in chronic exasperation.As they trudged side by side in a column of twos for the five-mile march back to the barracks, under full field packs, Prentice was determined not to open any conversation. If they were going to talk at all, Quint would have to start it; and at least two and a half miles of silence went by before Quint said, &#34;Cherrystone clams.&#34;&#34;What?&#34;&#34;Just thinking about a meal I had once in San Francisco.&#34; Quint winced in tiredness as he eased his rifle sling into a more comfortable place on his shoulder. &#34;Best damn restaurant I&#39;ve ever been to in my life, only I can&#39;t remember the name of it. You ever have cherrystone clams? On the half shell?&#34;And soon they were engaged in what promised to be a long, wistful discussion of the ultimate and perfect dinner, a dinner presumably to be shared some day after the war in the best damn restaurant in the world. It would begin with cherrystone clams and proceed to a celebrated kind of soup that only Quint had ever tasted.&#34;Okay,&#34; Prentice said, &#34;and then what? A big steak, I guess, or a big piece of roast beef with--&#34;&#34;No. Hold on a second, Prentice; don&#39;t let&#39;s bolt the whole meal at once. You&#39;re forgetting all about the fish course.&#34;&#34;Okay.&#34; And as they debated possibilities for the fish course it was all Prentice could do to keep his voice from rising and giggling in pleasure like a girl&#39;s.&#34;Then we&#39;re agreed on fillet of sole, right?&#34; Quint said. &#34;All right, now it&#39;s time for the main dish. And listen, don&#39;t let&#39;s be too hasty about the steak or the roast beef--there&#39;s plenty of other things. Let&#39;s think a minute.&#34;Prentice thought a minute, and while thinking, he allowed one of his worst military habits to repeat itself. His toe scraped the heel of the man walking ahead of him, an ex-Engineer corporal named Connor whose heels, as he often and loudly told everyone, had been stepped on by Prentice every God damned time Prentice followed him in the marching order. And because Prentice had long since learned that no kind of apology would work with Connor, he could only assume a grave and self-protective look of idiocy when Connor turned around and said, &#34;God damn it, Prentice, will you watch your feet?&#34; There followed a silence of ten or twelve paces, while Prentice wondered how soon it would be all right to resume the talk of the ideal dinner.It was Quint, gratifyingly, who broke the silence, &#34;Come to think of it,&#34; he said, &#34;I guess you&#39;re right, Prentice. There isn&#39;t anything better than a steak. Let&#39;s make it two filet mignons, then, medium rare. And what&#39;ll we have on the side? French fries, I guess, but I mean what kind of vegetable? Or would you rather skip the vegetable and have a salad?&#34;&#34;Right. Let&#39;s do that. Let&#39;s just have a big sal--&#34; and then, hating himself, he stepped on Connor&#39;s heel again. But there was barely time for Connor to turn around and say, &#34;Prentice, will you watch your fucking feet?&#34;--there was barely time for that before Prentice saw something funny in the movements of the men ahead. Far up in front, where the captain was, they had all hunched over and broken into a trot, and they seemed to be taking off their helmets. Nearer, just ahead of Connor, some of them had stopped and buckled over as if in pain; and then, before he could bring his mind into focus, something small and indistinct fell into the dust at his feet and exploded with a soft little noise--Pluff!--and his eyes and throat were attacked by fire.He couldn&#39;t see and he couldn&#39;t breathe. He crouched, both hands grabbing for his eyes as his rifle swung clumsily loose at his elbow.&#34;Keep moving, men,&#34; somebody was calling. &#34;Keep moving...&#34;Stumbling and pushed heavily from behind, he lost his balance and fell on the road and rolled, legs in the air--all this happened before the first clear thought occurred to him: Tear gas.And it was an agonizingly long time after that, while he scrabbled on all fours to retrieve his rolling helmet, before he thought of what to do about it--before his right hand clawed at the canvas pouch that had ridden under his left armpit for weeks, tore it open, and pulled out the wobbling rubber paraphernalia of his gas mask.</p><h2>World&#39;s End</h2><p>Walter Van Brunt, woozy with pot, cheap wine, and sex, collides with his own historical roots when he crashes his motorcycle into a historical marker along the highway</p><p>T. Coraghessan Boyle, author of <i>Water Music</i>, a hilarious reinvention of the exploration of the Niger, returns to his native New York State with this darkly comic historical drama exploring several generations of families in the Hudson River Valley. Walter Van Brunt begins the book with a catastrophic motorcycle accident that sends him back on a historical investigation, eventually encompassing the frontier struggles of the late 1600s. Any book that opens with a three-page "list of principal characters" and includes chapters titled "The Last of the Kitchawanks," "The Dunderberg Imp," and "Hail, Arcadia!" promises a welcome tonic to the self-conscious inwardness of much contemporary fiction; <i>World's End</i> delivers and was rewarded with the PEN/Faulkner Award for 1988.T.

This book is one of the most powerful biblical and scientific defenses of a straightforward view of Genesis creation ever written. <b>Updated &amp; Expanded in 2011.</b></p><p>Born in Australia, Jonathan Sarfati moved to New Zealand as a child and later majored in chemistry at Victoria University of Wellington. In 1996, he returned to Australia and took a position as a research scientist and editorial consultant for the Creation Science Foundation in Brisbane. His first book, Refuting Evolution, has sold over 350,000 copies. He co-authored the best-selling The Answers Book, and is a former New Zealand Chess Champion."Genesis is foundational to all of Scripture, and so we must vigorously defend it as seriously as any other part of the Bible. Dr Sarfati has done an excellent job of critically analyzing and refuting the all-too-common compromise on Genesis by Christians today. As a leading proponent of the day-age theory and progressive creation, the astronomer Dr Hugh Ross is a major player in compromise. This book clearly demonstrates the serious biblical and scientific problems in the teachings of Hugh Ross. <i>Refuting Compromise</i> is a 'must read' for all Christians..." --<i>Dr Danny Faulkner, (Full) Professor of Astronomy/Physics, University of South Carolina - Lancaster</i></p><h2>Human Nature: The Japanese Garden of Portland, Oregon</h2><p>A guide and history to one of America&#39;s great gardens.

He was a carefree five-year-old, pampered by his parents and his nanny, when Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi Party, moved into the building opposite theirs in Munich.&nbsp;<br><br>In 1933 the joy of this untroubled life was shattered. Hitler had been named Chancellor. Edgar's parents, stripped of their rights as citizens, tried to protect him from increasingly degrading realities. In class, his teacher had him draw swastikas, and his schoolmates joined the Hitler Youth.&nbsp;<br><br>Watching events unfold from his window, Edgar bore witness to the Night of the Long Knives, the <i>Anschluss</i>, and <i>Kristallnacht</i>. Jews were arrested; his father was imprisoned at Dachau. In 1939 Edgar was sent on his own to England, where he would make a new life, a career, have a family, and strive to forget the nightmare of his past--a past that came rushing back when he decided, at the age of eighty-eight, to tell the story of his buried childhood and his infamous neighbor.</p><p><b>Edgar Feuchtwanger</b>&nbsp;was born in Munich in 1924 and immigrated to England in 1939.

Visit her online at www.martaperry.com.</p>Allison Standish was swept with an overpowering urge to throw the nearest heavy object or scream at the top of her lungs or, at the very least, slam the door. She did none of those things, clinging instead to the maxim she'd hammered out for herself years ago: if they see you lose control, they win.<br><br>She actually managed to pin a stiff smile on her face. "Sorry I interrupted." She turned and walked steadily toward the door of Greg's loft.<br><br>It was Diane, her boss, who rushed after her from the bedroom, wrapping a sheet around her abundant curves. "Allison, wait. This isn't what it looks like."<br><br>Allison's temper nearly slipped its leash at the trite remark. "It's exactly what it looks like. No wonder you were so eager to see me get on the road."<br><br>"Now, Allison." Diane reached for her with one hand while she grabbed the wandering sheet with the other.<br><br>The sheet was one of those Allison had picked out to go with the bedroom furniture she'd helped Greg choose. She'd even gotten him her professional designer's discount.<br><br>"Let's be adult about this," Diane continued. "There's no reason why we can't continue working together."<br><br>"Listen to her, baby." Greg appeared in the bedroom doorway, wearing a hastily donned T-shirt and shorts.<br><br>"Shut up." Diane tossed the words back over her shoulder.<br><br>Greg ran a hand through the shoulder-length black hair that inevitably attracted female attention. If he'd said something to her then...<br><br>But he didn't. He subsided, looking sulky. Diane had that effect on a lot of people.<br><br>"Come on, Ally." Di's voice turned coaxing. "These things happen. Take your week off. By the time you come back to the office, this will just be a memory. You have a good thing going. Don't ruin it."<br><br><em>For a man.</em> Di didn't say the words, but they were implied. Di wouldn't dream of sacrificing one single step of her career for a man. That was how she'd become manager of the most prestigious interior design firm in Philadelphia.<br><br>Allison found she actually could manage a smile at that. "Sorry. I guess I'm not really that adult." This time she did slam the door.<br><br>She'd gotten all the way to the car before reaction set in. It took her three tries to unlock the car door, and she slid behind the wheel, relieved that she didn't have to trust her legs to hold her up any longer. She clutched the steering wheel, willing herself not to be sick.<br><br>A rusty meow from the backseat demanded attention. If Hector had to be confined to the cat carrier, he considered the least she could do was keep the vehicle moving.<br><br>"In a minute," she muttered. If cats were supposed to sense one's mood, Hector was deficient in that ability.<br><br>Diane had been similarly concerned to get her moving this afternoon, suggesting Allison leave the office early so she could beat Philadelphia's rush-hour traffic. Clearly she hadn't anticipated that Allison would stop by Greg's loft to say goodbye before setting off for Amish country.<br><br>She nearly hadn't. Hector had been recalcitrant about getting into the cat carrier, wedging his fat orange-striped body under the dresser just out of her reach the instant he'd seen the carrier. She'd finally had to resort to a can of tuna to snag him.<br><br>Then, with cat carrier and suitcase stowed in her compact, she'd had, she thought, just enough time to give Greg a goodbye kiss before heading for the wilds of Lancaster County and the property she'd so surprisingly been left in her grandmother's will.<br><br>She'd probably known the truth when she'd spotted Diane's Volvo parked in front of Greg's building. Her head just hadn't been able to convince her heart. She'd had to see for herself.<br><br>Well, she'd seen, all right. Now she just had to figure out what she was going to do with her life.<br><br>Hector complained again. Loudly.<br><br>"All right, all right." She started the engine and pulled onto the street as cautiously as a sixteen-year-old learning to drive.<br><br>At least she had a breathing space before making any tough decisions. She'd already planned to spend a week in Laurel Ridge arranging to rid herself of the white elephant her birth father's mother had so surprisingly left her. But now she didn't have any reason to rush back.<br><br>Allison joined the steady stream of traffic heading out of the city. There would be other jobs. One thing she could say about Di: her code, whatever it was, might allow her to poach a friend's man, but she wouldn't stoop to withhold a glowing reference, even if it meant Allison would be decorating multimillion-dollar homes for one of her competitors.<br><br>As for Greg&#x2014;well, apparently he didn't live by any code at all except the whim of expediency. Allison must have had blinders on not to see that. Still, it was easy to be dazzled in the early stages of love, or whatever had passed for love between them.<br><br>Several hours later, Allison had begun to think she'd also had blinders on when she'd read the map and decided she could reach Laurel Ridge before dark. The April evening had quickly faded, and only the faintest glow on the western horizon remained. She seemed to have been wandering past fields and forests on a two-lane county route for hours, and the sole vehicle she'd passed in miles had been an Amish buggy.<br><br>The GPS she relied on was not helpful. Its metallic voice hadn't contributed anything in the past half hour but a persistent "Recalculating" that was nearly as annoying as Hector's raucous complaints. When the cat started sounding like a rusty hinge, it meant the situation was getting desperate.<br><br>Her tired brain played with the idea that Laurel Ridge didn't exist, that her legacy was one last spiteful act on the part of the grandmother who'd never acknowledged Allison's existence while she was alive.<br><br>Pondering the possibility, Allison nearly missed the sign. She stopped, backed up and read the words she'd been looking for. Laurel Ridge, 2 Miles. Relief swept over her, and she put the car in gear.<br><br>"Cheer up, Hector. The end is in sight."<br><br>A doubtful scratch at the carrier's door was his only response.<br><br>A few minutes later she was driving down Laurel Ridge's main, and maybe only, business street. Storefronts were dark and foot traffic nonexistent. Apparently Laurel Ridge shut down early. The only sign of life was a caf� and, across the street, a bed-and-breakfast with a porch light left on. Probably for her, since she'd booked a room there for the week.<br><br>As she pulled to the curb, Allison's gaze was caught by the building next to the bed-and-breakfast. In contrast to the homey Victorian charm of the white clapboard inn, this building loomed over the street, three stories of Italianate classic architecture dwarfing the smaller buildings around it. She could just make out the brass plate attached to the wrought-iron gate. Blackburn House. So this was her inheritance.<br><br><em>An Italianate mansion dating from the 1850s.</em> The attorney's voice, dry and pedantic, sounded in her mind. <em>It belonged to Laurel Ridge's founding family. Your late grandfather purchased it from the Blackburn family fifty years ago. He had it zoned commercial and divided to form several shops and offices.</em><br><br>The attorney's voice had sounded disapproving, either of the property or, more likely, of her.<br><br>Allison had mentally translated his description into old and dilapidated, with the architectural integrity of the original house compromised by ill-conceived renovations. But from the outside, at least, the building looked well kept, its paint flawless, small lawn smooth and green, and early spring daffodils in bloom along the front walk. A porch wrapped around the sides of the building, and a round tower anchored each end of the front.<br><br>Allison slid out and hauled the cat carrier from the backseat. "There it is, Hector. What do you think of it?"<br><br>Hector's snarl was probably meant to express his displeasure with his confinement, but it echoed her feelings quite well.<br><br>At least she ought to be able to realize some profit from the place when she put it on the market. Aside from a few random gifts that had been totally unsuited to either her age or interests, her father hadn't contributed much but a name and an accumulation of genes to her life. Maybe his mother had decided to make a last gesture toward rectifying his failure with her bequest.<br><br>"We may as well have a look. Don't you think so?" Talking to the cat was becoming a habit. Was that a sign that she'd eventually turn into an old maid with no one in her life but cats? At least Hector didn't betray her or smash her dreams to bits.<br><br>Holding the cat carrier in one hand and fishing for the keys the lawyer had sent her with the other, Allison advanced on the door of Blackburn House.<br><br>Nick Whiting stepped out into the cool April evening, the lock clicking behind him on the door to the old Blackburn carriage house, now the workshop of Whiting and Whiting Cabinetry. The only way he'd convinced his father to go home in time for supper was to assure Dad he'd stop back later to check on the shipment of brushed pewter cabinet knobs that had been guaranteed delivery today.<br><br>It was important for Nick to be home for supper with Jamie, important to supervise his son's first-grade homework and to go through the bedtime rituals with him. When you were six, that sort of thing mattered.<br><br>Not that Mom or Dad wouldn't have been happy to take over, but where his son was concerned, Nick didn't take shortcuts. Jamie might have lost out in the mother department, but he'd always know he could rely on his dad.<br><br>So he'd settled Jamie in the twin bed in the room Nick and his brother had shared as kids, tucking him under the tractor quilt that was Jamie's favorite. And then he'd driven the mile back into town to the shop.<br><br>The package had been leaning against the door, probably having arrived soon after they'd left. He stowed it away in the workshop, pleased the supplier had come through. This meant they could finish Mrs. Phelps's new kitchen cabinets tomorrow, unless she changed her mind yet again. He'd lingered in the shop for a few minutes, looking over the finished cabinets one last time. He liked checking the progress of the work on hand, enjoyed running his palm over the warm maple and the elegant curves of their custom cabinets.<br><br>Nick grinned into the dark. He'd seen his dad do the same thing often enough. It must be a Whiting family trait, one that had somehow skipped his brother, Mac. Double-checking the door, Nick headed for his car, thinking about the wedge of cherry pie Mom would have saved for him.<br><br>A light from one of the windows of Blackburn House caught his eye as he rounded the corner of the building, and he paused. First floor&#x2014;it was in the bookstore. Ralph or his clerk must be working late, maybe unpacking a new shipment of books. Even as he thought it, the light switched off. Five steps later the light reappeared, in the quilt shop this time.<br><br>He stopped, frowning. Sarah Bitler wasn't likely to be in her shop at this hour. Sarah was Amish, and she didn't like driving her buggy along the country roads after dark. Apprehension slid along Nick's skin like a touch, and he reached into his pocket for his keys.<br><br>The light went out and the pattern repeated as another came on, this time in his showroom. Someone was getting into the businesses on the first floor of Blackburn House. Yanking his keys out, Nick ran for the back door.<br><br>A prowler? It could be the custodian, he supposed, but Fred Glick was usually gone by this hour, and making a final pass through the building wasn't characteristic of his lackadaisical approach to his job.<br><br>The rumors that had been making the rounds in town popped into his mind. Laurel Ridge couldn't seem to decide whether it was being plagued by a prowler, a Peeping Tom or a sneak thief. Maybe now he'd get the answer to that question.<br><br>Nick held the knob firmly as he unlocked the back door, wary of any betraying creak as he eased it open. Stepping inside, he considered his brother Mac's reaction if Nick actually caught the prowler. Mac, Laurel Ridge's police chief, had been skeptical from the start about the rumors, saying it was probably a manifestation of cabin fever after the long winter.<br><br>Nick slipped past the storerooms at the back of the building and slowly opened the door that led to the front part of the house. The wide hallway that ran from this point to the front of the building was deserted, but a patch of light lay on the marble floor. Staying in the shadow cast by the wide center staircase, Nick moved silently forward. To judge by the location of the light, the intruder was in their showroom. He heard the sound of movement, as if something brushed against a cabinet.<br><br>If he went to the showroom door, he'd be seen instantly. But he could slip in the door that led from the hallway to the office behind the showroom, and he might be able to get close enough to see without being seen. Pulse racing, Nick crossed to the office door and fumbled for the key. He realized he was enjoying this small adventure, and he had to laugh at himself. Maybe a guy never outgrew all those cops versus bad guys scenarios of childhood.<br><br>Holding his breath, Nick pushed open the door and sidled into the office. No one was here, but a stream of light spilled from the open door into the showroom. He worked his way around the desk and groped the wall next to the door. He paused there for a moment and then cautiously peered into the showroom.<br><br>The rows of cabinet doors on display made an effective screen. He couldn't see the guy from here, but he could hear footsteps, followed by a soft thud as something bumped one of the cabinets.<br><br>Nick held his breath and moved soundlessly farther into the showroom, taking cover behind a Peg-Board displaying hardware styles. The footsteps came nearer. Frowning in concentration, Nick counted the steps, estimating the prowler's location. One step, two&#x2014;he must be within a foot now, so close Nick imagined he could hear a breath.<br><br>Muscles tense, he waited. The instant he saw movement, he lunged, grabbing the form. Several things happened at once. He realized he was clutching a female, he felt her swing something and he heard the crack as it hit his leg with numbing force. Another crack, a banshee shriek and an orange ball of fur plummeted toward the floor.<br><br>The cat turned on a dime, hissed and spat at him, spine arching. The woman, yanking free of his grasp, looked as if she'd like to do the same. Nick had a quick image of shining auburn hair, pale creamy skin and bright green eyes that seemed to shoot sparks of rage.<br><br>"What are you doing? Are you insane?"

Mack Little, Brown and Company 1976</p><p>John Mack, M.D., was Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, and Founding Director of the Center for Psychology and Social Change, Cambridge, Massachusetts.A hugely admired, and Pulitzer prize-winning, biography which concentrates on the relationship between Lawrence's inner life and the actions and events which grew out of them. It is easy to warm to a biographer who, while drawing on his training as a psychiatrist, is never deceived into thinking that theory can 'explain' his Lawrence. The more Mack discovered about the social contexts of Lawrence's actions and the demands on a public man, the more he understood Lawrence's psychology. The result is a resounding confirmation of this approach to his subject. (Desmond Christy <i>The Guardian</i>)<br><br>We are not likely to get as thorough and judicious a biography of T. E.

In the second half of the seventeenth century, he extended France&#39;s frontiers into the Netherlands and Germany, and established colonies in America, Africa and India. Louisiana, which once occupied a third of the territory of the present-day United States, is named after him. Louis was also one of the greatest patrons of European history - Molire, Racine, Lully, Le Brun, le Ntre all worked for him. The stupendous palace he built at Versailles, and its satellites at Marly and Trianon, became the envy of monarchs all over Europe, frequently imitated but never surpassed. In all his palaces, Louis encouraged dancing, hunting, music and gambling. He loved conversation, especially with women: the power of women in Louis&#39;s life and reign is a particular theme of this book.Louis was obsessed by the details of government, and travelled extensively around his kingdom, but often his choices for ministers and generals proved disastrous. After the death of his very able minister Colbert, the extraordinary cost of building palaces and waging continuous wars devastated French finances and helped set France on the path to revolution. In 1685, his decision to revoke toleration for Protestants damaged his country, and alienated Protestant Europe and at the end of his life, his forces were persistently defeated by the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy. Nevertheless, by his death, he had helped make his grandson king of Spain, where his descendants still reign, and France had taken essentially the shape it has today.Philip Mansel&#39;s King of the World is much the most comprehensive and up-to-date biography of this hypnotic, flawed figure in English. It draws on all the latest research in France, Britain and America and pays special attention to the culture of the court, on which Mansel is an acknowledged expert</p><p></p><h2>The Disobedience of The Daughter of The Sun</h2><p>Cultural Writing. Native American Studies. In a luminescent testimony to the ancient teaching ability of story, internationally acclaimed lecturer, artist and author of Secrets of the Talking Jaguar, and Long Life, Honey in the Heart, Martin Prechtel brings alive the powerful Tzutujil Mayan tale of THE DISOBEDIENCE OF THE DAUGHTER OF THE SUN. Prechtel&#39;s gripping and inimitable style gives the reader a beautifully told and illustrated tale followed by five &#34;layers&#34; of commentary that present the deeper Indigenous understandings buried in the story, as well as Prechtel&#39;s own thoughts for modern people, on global warming, ecstasy and time.</p><p>Martin Prechtel's life, the well known subject of his previous books Secrets of the Talking Jaguar and Long Life, Honey in the Heart, took him from his native New Mexico upbringing as a half-blood, native American from a Pueblo Indian reservation to the village of Santiago Atitlan where he eventually served the Tzutujil Mayan population as a full village member becoming a principal in the body of village leaders, responsible for instructing the young people in the meanings of their ancient stories that took place in the rituals of adult rights of passage. <p>Mart�n once again resides in his native New Mexico where he is a writer, teacher, speaker, musician, and healer.

Since he arrived in Vancouver from Germany in 1953, Fred Herzog has roamed the city&#39;s back streets with his camera. Herzog draws upon documentary traditions while incorporating an outsider&#39;s sensitivity to a new environment. His colour images of street life in the 1950s and &#39;60s prefigure the &#34;New Color&#34; of photographers such as Stephen Shore and William Eggleston.

His best works include Green Lantern/Green Arrow and Batman with Neal Adams, The Shadow with Mike Kaluta and The Question with Denys Cowan, all of which were hailed for sophisticated stories that expanded the artistic potential of the mainstream portion of the medium. As an editor, he is principally known for editing Batman. His 1970s run on Batman is perhaps his most well known endeavour, turning Batman from the campiness of the 1960s TV show, to &#34;The Batman&#34;, getting back to the character&#39;s darker roots and emphasizing his detective skills. This grimer and more sophisticated Dark Knight, as well as new villians such as Ra&#39;s Al Ghul, brought back Batman from the verge of pop culture oblivion. His work would influence later incarnations of Batman, from the seminal comic &#34;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&#34; by Frank Miller, to the movie Batman Begins in 2005.</p><h2>Rhett Butler&#39;s People</h2><p>Fully authorized by the Margaret Mitchell estate<b>, <i>Rhett Butler's People</i> </b>is the astonishing and long-awaited novel that parallels the Great American Novel, <i>Gone With The Wind</i>. Twelve years in the making, the publication of <b><i>Rhett Butler's People</i> </b>marks a major and historic cultural event.<br> <br>Through the storytelling mastery of award-winning writer Donald McCaig, the life and times of the dashing Rhett Butler unfolds. Through Rhett's eyes we meet the people who shaped his larger than life personality as it sprang from Margaret Mitchell's unforgettable pages: Langston Butler, Rhett's unyielding father; Rosemary his steadfast sister; Tunis Bonneau, Rhett's best friend and a onetime slave; Belle Watling, the woman for whom Rhett cared long before he met Scarlett O'Hara at Twelve Oaks Plantation, on the fateful eve of the Civil War. <br> <br>Of course there is Scarlett. Katie Scarlett O'Hara, the headstrong, passionate woman whose life is inextricably entwined with Rhett's: more like him than she cares to admit; more in love with him than she'll ever know�&#x20ac;�<br> <br>Brought to vivid and authentic life by the hand of a master, <b><i>Rhett Butler's People</i></b> fulfills the dreams of those whose imaginations have been indelibly marked by <i>Gone With The Wind</i>.</p><p>Margaret Mitchell's story of Scarlett O'Hara's and Rhett Butler's beguiling, twisted love for each other, set against the gruesome background of a nation torn apart by war, is by all accounts epic--so much so that it feels untouchable. Yet McCaig's take on what many would consider a sacred cow of 20th-century American literature is a worthy suitor for Mitchell's many ardent fans, for reasons that may not be altogether obvious. It would be easy to look at <i>Gone With the Wind</i> and <i>Rhett Butler&#x2019;s People</i> side by side and catalog what is accurate and what isn't and tally up the score. In doing so, however, the fan is apt to miss out on the best part of this whole book: Rhett Butler himself. McCaig's Rhett is thoroughly modern, both a product of his Charleston plantation and an emphatic rejection of it. He is filled with romance and ingenuity, grit and wit, and a toughness matched only by a sense of humility that evokes so gracefully the hardship and heartbreak of a society falling apart. It's not hard to love Rhett in his weakness for Scarlett's love, but it is entirely amazing to love him as he rescues Belle Watling, mentors her bright young son Tazewell, adores his sister Rosemary, dotes on dear Bonnie Blue, and defends his best friend Tunis Bonneau to the very end.<p></p> <p>To pluck a character from a beloved book and recalibrate the story's point-of-view isn't an easy thing to do. Ultimately, the new must ring true with the old, and this is where <i>Rhett Butler&#x2019;s People</i> succeeds beyond measure. In the spirit of Mitchell's masterpiece, McCaig never questions that love--of family, lover, land, or country--is the tie that binds these characters to life, for better or worse. --<i>Anne Bartholomew</i></p><br><p><b>Rhett Butler</b></p><p><i>Renegade.

And then there's Katie Scarlett O'Hara herself&#x2015;the headstrong, passionate woman whose life is inextricably entwined with Rhett's: more like him than she cares to admit; more in love with him than either of them will ever know...</p><br><p><b>"Get inside Rhett's head as he meets and courts Scarlett in one of the most famous love affairs of all time..."&#x2015;<i>The New York Times</i></b></p></p><h2>Ridgerunner: Elusive Loner of the Wilderness</h2><p>During the early 1940s in Idahos expansive Selway-Bitterroot wilderness, a few items disappeared from a tent camp, then from a lookout tower, and a ranger station.

In 1941, before the attack on Pearl Harbor, he joined the U. S. Navy and was later trained to command small PT attack boats. He served in the Navy in the North and South Atlantic theaters and was on his way to the Pacific campaign when the war ended in 1945. He returned to New York and joined his wife and five year-old son, Peter.

He wrote novels, plays, short stories, reviews, movie scripts and a very popular biography of the actor Humphrey Bogart. Much of his material was drawn from his life in New York and Nantucket, MA, where the family had a summer home. He found the small town life in Nantucket was rich in characters and material for adventures. He wrote a book titled The Off-Islanders, which was later made into a successful movie called "The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!" It was the story of a Russian submarine run aground on a small New England island. Several of his other books were also made into movies.</p><p>His sideline as a painter of landscapes led to his participation in many gallery showings.</p><p>Mr. Benchley used his fascination with history to create a series of books for beginning and teen readers.

Today the NIV is accepted by over 60 denominations---more than any other translation---and is supported by a library of reference resources unmatched by any other translation. * King James Version -- The classic King James Version (KJV), beloved by generations of Bible readers, was first published in England in 1611. Commissioned by King James I, it was the achievement of nearly fifty translators, who over four years revised the Bishop&#39;s Bible in the light of available Greek and Hebrew documents as well as other contemporary European translations. The result was the first Authorized Version, known as to Americans as the King James Version. Subsequent editions corrected early misprints, modernized some spellings, and standardized features such as punctuation and italicization. The most famous revisions include the Cambridge edition of 1762, the Oxford edition of 1769, and Dr. F.H.A. Scrivener&#39;s Cambridge Paragraph Bible of 1873. Zondervan uses the Scrivener edition for its KJV Bibles. The NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSION is today&#39;s best-supported translation.

Anna was a German child when she had to flee from the Nazis before the War. By the time the bombs began to fall she was a stateless adolescent in London, and after it was all over she became a happily married Englishwoman who thought she had put the past behind her. This omnibus edition of the three volumes of Judith Kerr&#39;s Hitler trilogy, tells her story beginning with the rise of Hitler in 1933 through to her return to Berlin years after the war.</p><p>Judith Kerr was born in Berlin, the daughter of a distinguished German writer. She left Germany with her family in 1933 to escape from the Nazis and they arrived in England in 1936, having spent the intervening years in Switzerland and France. She has a daughter who is a designer and a son who is a novelist. Judith lives in London.Acclaim for When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit: `... a compassionate introduction to the whole subject of World War II...&#39; Books for your Children `... an extremely exciting adventure story...&#39; Daily Express `... a charming and touching book, often very funny...&#39; Daily Mail `... exact, intelligent and unsentimental.&#39; Sunday Telegraph</p><h2>Badiou: A Subject To Truth</h2><p>Alain Badiou is one of the most inventive and compelling philosophers working in France todayOCoa thinker who, in these days of cynical resignation and academic specialization, is exceptional in every sense. Guided by disciplines ranging from mathematics to psychoanalysis, inspired as much by Plato and Cantor as by Mao and Mallarm(r), BadiouOCOs work renews, in the most varied and spectacular terms, a decidedly ancient understanding of philosophyOCophilosophy as a practice conditioned by truths, understood as militant processes of emancipation or transformation. <br>This book is the first comprehensive introduction to BadiouOCOs thought to appear in any language. Assuming no prior knowledge of his work, it provides a thorough and searching overview of all the main components of his philosophy, from its decisive political orientation through its startling equation of ontology with mathematics to its resolute engagement with its principal competition (from Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and Deleuze, among others). The book draws on all of BadiouOCOs published work and a wide sampling of his unpublished work in progress, along with six years of correspondence with the author.a <br>Peter Hallward pays careful attention to the aspect of BadiouOCOs work most liable to intimidate readers in continental philosophy and critical theory: its crucial reliance on certain key developments in modern mathematics. Eschewing unnecessary technicalities, Hallward provides a highly readable discussion of each of the basic features of BadiouOCOs ontology, as well as his more recent account of appearance and OC being-there.OCO <br>Without evading the difficulties, Peter Hallward demonstrates in detail and in depth why BadiouOCOs ongoing philosophical project should be recognized as the most resourceful and inspiring of his generation.<br>"</p><p>Slavoj Zizek is senior researcher at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia.&#34;If Badiou&#39;s recent work is the event of contemporary philosophy, Hallward&#39;s book bears the greatest fidelity to this event--fidelity, not dogmatic allegiance and blind repetitive resume.&#34;</p><h2>Unrecounted</h2><p><p><strong>A gorgeous illustrated poetry collection by W. G. Sebald: "An extraordinarily handsome edition of poems by the late great writer" (<em>Confrontation</em>).</strong></p><em>Unrecounted</em> combines thirty-three of what W. G. Sebald called his "micropoems"&#x2015;miniatures as unclassifiable as all of his works&#x2015;with thirty-three exquisitely exact lithographs by one of his oldest friends, the acclaimed artist Jan Peter Tripp.<br><br> The lithographs portray, with stunning precision, pairs of eyes&#x2015;the eyes of Beckett, Borges, Proust Jasper Johns, Francis Bacon, Tripp, Sebald, Sebald's dog Maurice. Brief as haiku, the poems are epiphanic and anti-narrative. What the author calls "time lost, the pain of remembering, and the figure of death" here find a small home. The art and poems do not explain one another, but rather engage in a kind of dialogue. "The longer I look at the pictures of Jan Peter Tripp," Sebald comments in his essay, "the better I understand that behind the illusions of the surface, a dread-inspiring depth is concealed. It is the metaphysical lining of reality, so to speak." 33 black-and-white illustrations</p><p><p><strong>W. G. Sebald</strong> was born in Germany in 1944 and died in 2001.
